28-year-old chef found dead at a San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in the stairwell of a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he could not think of anyone who would want to harm him, saying "everything is finally getting better."
The San Francisco coroner's office said the body found at Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death was ruled a homicide and is under investigation.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC radio station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as an assembly chef in Boston, found an ideal job as an assembly chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "devastated" by Frank's death.
"We are a small group of people who get along like a close family, and we will miss him deeply," the spokesman said.
We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this sad time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in a guest house, but recently "things are finally getting better."
"Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a big heart.
"Frank often cooks dinner for his family," says Louis Galicia.
He was never willing to quarrel with his family.
He is a man of everyone's opinion.
"Everything in the world can go wrong," says Louis Galicia, "but Frank is an outsider who shines every day."
Anyone with information should call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Junior doctors strike: call for new industrial action
Junior doctors' representatives called on the union to approve new industrial action over the new contract dispute.
The British Medical Association's junior doctors' committee will ask all its members to support more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The junior doctors' committee said ministers had not addressed concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association in July.
Fifty-eight percent of the members who voted opposed the contract deal.
In a letter to members tweeted late on Thursday, junior doctors committee chair Ellen McCourt said the government had been "consistently silent" about the issues that led to the contract boycott.
"In light of this, the junior doctors committee's executive committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for renewed formal consultation on all concerns," she said.
In response to the government's reticence, the junior doctors committee's executive committee has today formally asked the BMA council to hold a special meeting to approve a long-term plan to escalate industrial action from early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out strike in NHS history.
Dr Johann Malawana, head of junior doctors at the British Medical Association, resigned following a vote against the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before 54,000 junior doctors voted with medical students, he had told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced among health care workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "out of step alliance"?
A gesture to end a crisis.
Russia and Turkey's leaders met on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in the glittering halls of a St. Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling that the rapprochement was what Ankara wanted most.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
Yet even by Mr Putin's normally reserved standards, his smile is shallow and barely warm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for his part, reportedly mentioned "good friend" Putin five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, or even higher.
The next day, a newspaper here wrote that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
But, I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
Mr Putin's continued coldness, however, suggests that he has forgotten nothing.
Indeed, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was fierce.
Mr. Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of behind Moscow's back.
Attacks from so-called friends are even harder to accept.
It is difficult, if not impossible, for both sides to re-establish real trust.
Public opinion in Russia has also reversed since November.
For months, the government-controlled media have carried out a shocking all-out assault on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious comes from accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdogan's family has profited from illegal oil deals in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has categorically denied the claim.
However, news from St Petersburg suggests it is time to move on.
After all, the meeting was premised on Putin receiving an apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are clear.
First, Erdogan, who narrowly escaped being ousted after last month's failed coup, needs the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attacks have obviously hit him hard.
There is also an economic incentive.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially by banning charter flights that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
That number has plummeted by nearly 90 per cent.
Travel agencies and charter companies in Russia are set to breathe a sigh of relief as flights resume.
They will see a wave of Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables would fall once Turkey's agricultural imports were liberalized again.
"The tourists went and the tomatoes came back," said a report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti.
The visit also has added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is furious at the West's feeble response to the takeover attempt.
Moreover, Ankara has long resented the slow pace of EU accession negotiations and the meddling of Vladimir Putin, who is keen to exploit political chill and weaken Turkey ’ s relations with the West.
The Russian leader is bound to get extra points from Ankara for championing the elected authorities after the failed coup.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has always harboured deep-seated fears of regime change.
As a result, the meeting at the glittering seaside palace forged an alliance between Russia and Turkey, two countries rejected and mistreated by the Western world, which one analyst described as a "misfits alliance."
However, despite the public rapprochement, significant differences remain between the two sides.
One key factor is Syria, where Moscow has been playing the peacemaker in recent days, while Russia and Turkey have backed opposing factions.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at the launch that the topic had not yet been addressed.
The Turkish president has deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides, while Putin has emphasized them.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to seek common ground on Syria.
With months of open hostility and the possibility of a major catastrophe following the downing of a Russian warplane by NATO member Turkey, it is surely a good thing that the two leaders have resumed talks.
RBS will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
The bank will be reduced to a logistics arm, according to the chief executive of RBS.
RBS will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand had been committed to its global ambitions.
But that pursuit was abandoned eight years ago when he was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sporting events such as Rugby Six Nations and Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to get more national brands to make their mark.
RBS will be used by Scottish customers but will not revert to its original form.
In England and Wales, all references outside the head office and the stock exchange will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Autonomous Region of Northern Ireland.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private banking brands, such as CCB, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness County.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investor brand as well as one of the employee hire brands, as we are now more of a bank with many brands."
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
For now, I would say that we are no longer focused on the global, we have turned our eyes to the local.
Each brand represents a difference in their respective industries, and our employees serve our customers through different brands.
RBS has indicated it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championships; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands sponsoring sporting events.
"It's time to become a multi-brand bank because privately we've been looking at ways to be a better customer service bank," the chief executive said.
It would have been ridiculed if three years ago we had aspired to be a big bank with lots of brands.
At the moment we are focusing on customer needs and I am sure you have noticed these changes.
I think we can relaunch these brands, and the time is right.
Dai Tully has a career of 3,000 wins thanks to Predilection's success in Newmarket
Newmarket's two victories helped Dayturi to a career-high 3,000 wins before he sprayed champagne to celebrate
On Friday, professional jockey Frankie Dettori notched his 3,000 win at Newmarket.
He raced down the track with Predilection, written by trainer John Gosden, to two victories that night and a career-high 3,000.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional jockey to reach this milestone in level racing.
The top five were Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"It's special," said Dai Tully, a three-time champion jockey who won in Ghayyar earlier.
I was thrilled because my family were there
I'm happy with what I've achieved at Newmarket because that's where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a massive race or the Royal Ascot, it's just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I'm relieved and humbled.
Datuoli elicited cheers for bringing in Predilection after his victory
The achievement was made by two jockeys in the obstacle course, champion jockey Richard Johnson and now retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has won more than 4,300 in his record-breaking career.
Berger is a nine-time German champion with 4,493 victories in his career
Dai Tully is one of the best jockeys of his generation, so it's no surprise that he achieved this milestone, which few have done before him.
He's stylish and athletic, but what really sets him apart in the weighing room is his tactical rationality.
He is an amazing equestrian ambassador whose enthusiasm and charisma have attracted a large number of fans to the sport over the years.
A few weeks ago, I told Daytully at Epsom that if he had been more than a weekend jockey with a big race, he should have been able to score 6,000 wins already!
Seriously, it's so important that he's Britain's best equestrian winner in three decades.
He has a lively personality, which is good for British horse racing, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Dai Tully celebrates the milestone with his signature jump and dismount
From jumping across the line to jumping off a horse, Dai Tully has been a typical representative of the British flat race field for two decades.
His career has been a roller coaster.
He won several tournaments, including the famous "seven wins" at the Royal Ascot in 1996, but he also suffered a plane crash and was banned for taking drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the game after a six-month ban, it was a struggle, but he showed amazing character strengths and finally returned to the top, giving skeptics a beating.
He may not be able to do it for much longer - Dai Tully has said before that he hopes to compete at least until he's 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff
Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, unexpectedly sacked Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff.
For years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of a core group that Mr. Putin has trusted.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed special representative for the environment and transport.
A Kremlin statement said Mr. Putin had "announced the dismissal of Ivanov as chief of staff of the Russian president," but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who started as Mr Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino, now 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he ran presidential drafts and government employees, according to the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
"Thank you for your trust," he told Mr. Putin after his appointment.
I believe that the most important task of this Government is to support the Head of State in drafting laws and implementing control directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself called for his resignation and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over.
Is such a smile convincing?
Moscow was puzzled by the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides and, like Putin, has worked for the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As chief of staff, he had been one of the country's most influential figures.
In a meeting with President Vladimir Putin broadcast on state television, both said the chief of staff had called for his resignation.
Despite the smiles on camera, few were convinced - especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of a defeat in some kind of power struggle?
Not yet known.
But the official narrative - that a candidate once seen as a presidential candidate suddenly chose to take charge of Russia's environmental policy - has attracted a lot of skepticism.
Quoting Mr. Ivanov's conversation with Mr. Putin on the Kremlin's website, he said: "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you in a conversation to give me this difficult position, or even a troublesome position, for a four-year term."
"As a result, I've been Chief of Staff to the President for four years and eight months."
Mr. Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Agency.
When Mr. Putin became head of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency) in the late 1990s, Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he designated Mr. Ivanov as one of his five most trusted people.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia at the end of Mr Putin's second term, as a third term was unconstitutional.
But the job ultimately went to Dmitry Medvedev, Mr Putin's other close aide.
Mr. Putin served as Russia's prime minister until he returned to the presidency in three and a half years.
Mysterious Fish Shows Banff in a Garden
A resident of Banff issued a request for help after spotting fish in his garden.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish may have been sand eels brought by tornadoes at sea.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the bizarre scene on Periscope, hoping someone could explain to him why the two-inch fish appeared.
The Kunsferri Bridge is now open to Fife.
The £1.35bn project is scheduled for completion in May 2017
Engineers have linked the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The four "bridge fan" arcs near each of the bridge's three bridgeheads are now nearing completion, and the project is the first of its kind.
The bridge, which began in Fife, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 stayed cables.
The £1.35bn project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today, becoming one of the first people to get on the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Quincy Bridge," he said.
We have all witnessed engineering work on such an ambitious project, using more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel for this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the combination between the viaduct and the deck required delicate work and very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the total deck has now been installed and the last section of the concrete deck is being poured in Rosyth today, meaning that all decks are in place.
"Whichever bridge project it is, the first one is a major milestone," said Michael Martin, project director at Quincy Bridge Construction.
For this remarkable project, Hailong has demonstrated cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
After installing the final section panel and connecting it to the expanded Northbridge Fort Road panel, the remaining gap junction on the north side or close to the land side needs to be completed.
The completion of this operation will require the relocation of the northern viaduct approach bridge 700 mm to the south.
It was a huge operation, and at the same time a very sophisticated one.
It is said to be huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons and needs to be pulled out at a slope of about 3 percent.
It's sophisticated because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, just a few millimetres on each side.
Thankfully, everything is going well.
Simon Byers wins women's gymnastics all-around title
Forget about stress.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is unaffected by all this.
The vault is full of energy.
balance beam.
The floor exercise was stunning.
The overall performance was excellent.
Now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast took the all-around title Thursday, fully demonstrating her talent for leading the world in gymnastics at the Olympics.
She topped silver medalist Aly Raisman, a member of the Final Five, and bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina of Russia with a combined score of 62.198.
Simon Byers from the United States performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers helped the U.S. team achieve a four-game winning streak in the women's individual all-around gymnastics at the Olympics, where she personally won five medals, further confirming that she is the best gymnast of her generation and probably of all time.
Byers couldn't hold back her tears when she saw her total score. She finally ended the long journey.
Byers thus ranks among the "once-in-a-decade athletes" like Michael Phelps, who take sports to new heights in their respective fields:
"Byers is the best gymnast I've ever seen," said 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton, who has dominated the sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 golds.
There's one final match in Brazil, but this one isn't so much Byers' rivalry with other gymnasts as it is her own battle with great expectations pressure.
If Byers hadn't returned to her home in Springs, Texas, loaded with gold medals, everyone would have been very disappointed.
Simon Byers (left) from the United States hugs Lesman, who won gold and silver in the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August (Thursday).
Byers won his first gold medal on Tuesday, a surprise gift to retiring national coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Byers insists he has no plans for the future as he takes over the title all year round, that's not quite the case.
One section of Byers's floor exercise, including her signature tumble, is played with Latin music, which she listens to in her residence just across the street from the Rio Olympic stadium.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted as a baby by her grandparents and spotted by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a gym field trip, has now grown into a backbone.
Byers hasn't lost in the all-around since the summer of 2013, and she's sure to win if she wants to.
Mustafina's slight lead after two turnovers was an illusion.
Byers, the reigning world champion in both the balance beam and floor exercise events, is waiting in the wings.
She scored 15.433 on the balance beam and 15.933 on the floor exercise.
While waiting for the final score, Leseman gave Byers a gentle hug. Byers burst into tears when he learned that he had achieved his dream.
Leseman acted a bit like revenge for four years ago, when she tied for third but lost to Mustafina in the decider.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, nicknamed "Grandma" by the Americans, was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after the floor exercise to announce her return, but such a return has sometimes seemed questionable before.
Byers, who is just 19 years old, has been viral on Twitter since earlier this week. For his part, his life has taken on a whole new meaning.
'Several Shot '6-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week, police said.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
Brown had multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, legs, arms and abdomen, they said, but the child was conscious on the way to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his tiny body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I couldn't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition in hospital and has undergone multiple surgeries.
His family told the station that the child was expected to recover.
He was to have started first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Of the other three people who were shot, two were 29 and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition.
The child was found in the front seat of the car with the 29-year-old victim in critical condition, the station said.
Two other victims were not in the vehicle and police are investigating whether the gunman was among those injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia it looked like multiple gunmen exchanged gunfire.
A number of shell casings of offensive weapons were found at the scene, from which it can be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons.
Judging from this, it is undoubtedly an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
"So, this shows that there were a number of armed men on the scene at the time in a state of heavy fighting," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
A number of houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
No arrests have been made and police are said to be looking at surveillance video.
Also on Tuesday, a six-year-old child (girl) was hit in the arm by a stream while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is now recovering and police are still hunting the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie?
That's how I rate this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the gymnastics team has three elite gymnasts – Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez – who have inspired many girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the team's composition, which includes Aly Raisman of Judaism and Madison Kocian of the Catholic Church.
The team finally looked like the American team.
It also cemented the pinnacle of black and Latino women in the sport.
The leading female gymnast has been African-American for the past four years.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle finished first and second.
This is amazing.
The United States cheered when Gabrielle Douglas "unexpectedly" became an Olympic champion at the last Olympics.
Today, the world can witness the remarkable performances of three-time world champions Simon Byers, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have performed routine gymnastics to perfection.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team achieve a four-game winning streak in the women's individual all-around event.
Her teammate, Ali Lesman, scooped the silver medal.
We have reached the pinnacle of the sport, but not in the national gymnastics classroom.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie entered the Olympic team in the same way as Ali and Madison.
They are the Final Five because the next Olympic gymnastics team will be made up of four gymnasts, Marta Karolyi's final year in charge.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, with gymnasts training mainly in private gymnastics clubs, their parents paying for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotels (including the cost of coaches and gymnasts and their families), and a growing list of expenses.
Most of the gymnastics clubs are located in the affluent suburbs that support the industry.
All the gymnasts' training is done at these clubs, which is a long and expensive expense for the families of the gymnasts.
Byers' coach, Aimee Boorman, and Hernandez's coach, Maggie Haney, have coached the two gymnasts since they started gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics to the millions of young girls who have been influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provided free, inexpensive gymnastics in black neighborhoods to more than 15,000 urban youth, mainly black and Hispanic, and produced national and even world championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps to develop physical strength, flexibility and coordination. It also helps to develop a hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can have lifelong benefits for a person's health, academic and professional success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is significant, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you to Simon, Ali, Lawrie, Gabrielle and Madison for their "girl power" in winning the Olympic team gold medal, and for inspiring so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the path to health, strength and success.
Junior doctors plan to launch further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the change by accepting a modified contract from officials at the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the vote opposed the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying the NHS was in a "vacuum" and that a slight delay would hurt staff and patients.
The new contract first mentions changes to junior doctors' overnight and weekend working practices to improve care during irregular working hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's junior doctors committee, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will exacerbate the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks to go before the first doctors sign a new contract, we need to make progress and time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve disputes through negotiation, but people have been reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government has responded with silence.
That said, just last month we got a commitment from Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to take action now to remove enforcement and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he doesn't, junior doctors have made it clear they are ready for further industrial action.
The last strike, at the end of April, led to the postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultant doctors covered for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the BMA's revised contract.
The BMA wants to secure better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employees, has called on junior doctors not to stage any more strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action has had little effect but has instead put pressure on already committed teams and services, leading to fear, anxiety and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been in ongoing negotiations with the Junior Medical Officers Board and have been working with the Department of Health and others to respond positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and whistle-blowing.
Employers' desire to continue to actively explore other important topics – such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for those returning to work after a career break, training costs, a common understanding of the syllabus, further education leave and gender pay differentials in healthcare – illustrates the importance employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health attach to the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
£2 a day drugs can reduce heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 a day drug that officials are recommending will be rolled out to more patients and will last longer.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The drug is taken continuously for 12 months after a heart attack and can reduce the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), advises patients to stay on medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now NICE, the NHS regulator, recommends giving patients medication for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
About 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them continue to suffer a heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty deposits that form plaques on the walls of arteries.
If the plaque breaks, it can lead to a blood clot, which in turn blocks the flow of blood to the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the clot moves, it enters the bloodstream, preventing blood from flowing to the brain, leading to a stroke.
Patients who have already experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of another heart attack.
Ticagre, made by British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, can reduce the risk of disease by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The draft NICE guidance, released today, advises patients to take 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, and 60 mg of ticagrelor and two aspirin daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite effective secondary prevention treatment, up to one in four people with a history of heart attack will suffer another attack or stroke, often with serious consequences."
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that ticagrelor, taken in combination with aspirin, may be effective in reducing the risk of heart attack recurrence and stroke in patients who have experienced a heart attack.
We are deeply relieved that the temporary referral from Ticagrelor will provide more treatment options for the thousands of people who will benefit.
Given the limited information available on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor after three years, in particular the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend its continued use beyond this period.
Computer culture makes' electoral fraud 'prevalent in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was ousted last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
A culture of "political correctness" has turned a blind eye to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, the devastating government report reveals today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former cabinet minister, accused police, election regulators and town halls of turning a blind eye to evidence of election abuse because they were "overly sensitive to issues of ethnicity and religion."
Police should be allowed to set up cordons outside polling stations to protect fearful voters, the former minister of community affairs and now the top anti-corruption official said.
He advised voters to bring their identity papers with them when they cast their ballots to confirm their identity.
For now, voters simply have to give their name and address.
The report even suggested putting indelible ink on voters "fingers to prevent someone from casting a second ballot.
Sir Eric said protection for whistleblowers should be increased.
He called for increased media access to parliamentary documentation and decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups.
"It's not just about protecting against electoral fraud, it's about protecting local governments from the widespread culture of corruption and the financial scams that go hand-in-hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral tribunal ruled that incumbent Mayor Rahman was guilty of a string of corruption and wrongdoing and should be removed from office.
The court found that Rahman had "very ridiculously abused" the religious feelings of the Muslim community and had kept his mouth shut about allegations that Sword had accused him of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "declared on the campaign trail that it is a religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
As many as 300 ballots are in doubt and may have been cast by voters impersonating someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
In particular, he warned of electoral fraud by mail, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on voters to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) gave a number of suggestions for cleaning up the voting mechanism, including bringing identification papers to confirm his identity
"Evidence suggests that senior members, particularly in Pakistani and Bangladeshi background communities, put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote as they wish," he said in the report.
"Being overly sensitive to racial divisions and religious' political correctness', they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behavior."
Sir Eric has made 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism, including barring political activists from processing mailed ballot papers to prevent "vote harvesting."
The report, which also calls for rigorous checks on registration information to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and welfare scams, is also being considered by Theresa May.
The proposals include requiring voters to show identification before they cast their ballots.
Smear indelible ink on voters' fingers after the vote to prevent someone from casting a second ballot.
Systematically verify the ethnic affiliation of voters to ensure eligibility to vote.
Set the validity period for automatic mail voting requests at three years.
Political activists and activists are prohibited from handling completed postal ballots and mailing ballot envelopes.
The police are authorized to set up a cordon around the polling station.
The legal provisions were amended to make it easier to bring charges of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photographs at a polling station.
It is stipulated that only English may be used at polling stations (except in the Welsh region).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the rule that "voters go to the voting hall alone."
Sir Eric lashed out at the Metropolitan Police, saying it was' astonishing 'that they had not made any criminal charges following the incident at Tower Hamlets.
"Rahman and his election officer were subject to a number of corrupt and illegal practices and were thus disqualified by the Electoral Tribunal," he said.
By the standards of criminal proof, he is indisputably guilty in many respects.
He also took a swipe at the town hall election registration office's sham "tick check."
Sir Eric said: "The court's judgment against Tower Hamlets last year was a wake-up call for everyone."
Our country has a proud tradition of being the "mother of parliaments," but the secretive electoral fraud and subsequent denial by certain institutions is worrying and threatens this good reputation.
Cyclists who look like Princess Kate and bump into other celebrities at the Rio Olympics are sought after
Pauline Ferrand Prevot, the French cyclist who looked exactly like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was courted by viewers this week.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is not the only gold-medal contender to bump into a celebrity at this summer's games, at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the celebrity faces that appeared on screen at the time, FEMAIL put together a list of Olympians who hit Hollywood stars.
Hunters and wolves: US men's archery player Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to the cyclist who bumped into Kate on the track, many Internet users quickly discovered that an archer was the twin brother of Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, an American male archer, has caused a huge stir on social media since pictures of him posing as the star of the Wolf of Wall Street emerged on Twitter.
In fact, the archer sensed the hype on social media and admitted that as a child he had been told that he looked like a prune.
"I don't think I look much alike except for my beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking dude, so I guess that's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons at London 2012 will undoubtedly find more similarities this year: British long jumper Greg Rutherford looks a lot like the famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Aliya Mustafina, a Russian gymnast with big talking eyes, is accused of looking exactly like Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
And in swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to "Glee" star Matthew Morrison for years.
Dressup: The user believes Nathan Adrian is a 'sporty version' of the Inception actor
Another pair often compared are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have thick eyebrows and lips that look alike.
Silver medal-winning Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalynne McCord have the same tan and blonde hair, while Team USA's Ni Jiajun has been likened by fans to a "sporty version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."

Not the only one: One Twitter user was happy to find that others saw the similarities as well
Communication theory: According to this user, the pair may look alike for a reason

Indeed, the American football star and the Bloodthirsty Forensic star have very similar faces and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerri Walsh Jennings, who has a smile almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gymnast Gabby Douglas, who won gold, who has a beautiful and radiant smile similar to that of Bringing It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologises for Chinese swimmer's' slow as a pig 'comment
Byron MacDonald's comments Wednesday about 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay infuriated viewers who watched the live broadcast of the Olympics on CBC
CBC was forced to apologise after a commentator for the Canadian broadcaster CBC said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started off faster than the stench" and ended up "as slow as a pig."
Narrator Byron MacDonald made some comments at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," said Byron, who was a "tinted" commentator on the CBC team.
Being so excited, he started to swim faster than the stench, but then he was as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
Ai Yan, a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, finished second in 1: 57.79 -- 1.61 seconds behind Canada's Taylor Ruck, which helped Canada close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada were taken aback by the narrator's tone and phrasing, and they were quick to react online
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "The CBC commentator said the Chinese 14-year-old swimmer was' slow as a pig '??"
This idiot didn't realize it was live.
"That 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," said Ai Yanhan, a Chinese teenager who competed in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
Twitter's criticism of Byron McDonnell quickly spread across the tweets, with many calling for it to drop out of the commentary.
When Twitter users heard that Byron McDonald was slow to respond, they didn't stop there.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow # Byron MacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada, and your words and actions make us all sound like a bunch of racists. # That's disgusting.
Shortly after, CBC radio host Scott Russel apologized live for Byron's comments, saying: "We apologize for the comments about the performance of the live swimmers."
"We're sorry for the inappropriate language."
CBC apologised more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the comment
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron
CBC later copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting Byron's comments
The channel also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We are extremely sorry to say this and broadcast it live.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologise to viewers who watched us live and those who followed us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's commentary was aimed at the swimmer's performance, but not at her personally.
That is to say, the wording is indeed inappropriate, for which Byron deeply regrets.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonnell apologized during a live broadcast, saying there was nothing personal about his words and attempting to use them to excuse his remarks.
"I want to take a moment to apologize for the comments I made last night after the women's relay," he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I'm just commenting on the swimmer's performance, not the individual."
"Of course, I meant no disrespect, and I'm sorry."
Primark shoppers express outrage at a woman who brazenly tried on her underwear in the middle of the store
A woman undresses to try on her underwear in the middle of a Primark store where shoppers don't know where to look.
To make matters worse, she also looked at how she looked when she put it on, before taking her underwear off and putting it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The woman kept trying on her underwear inside the Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone before putting it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was also at the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mystery woman "got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything."
"People couldn't believe what they were seeing," she said.
She just stood in the middle of the store, took a pair of panties off the shelf, took off her tights and underwear, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a secluded place to try it on - she just stood there, it was cheeky."
"Everyone was stunned when she took her underwear off again. Obviously, she was still not satisfied because she put it back on the shelf."
After that, she tried three more like this, only to find none of them to her liking, then dressed again and walked out of the store.
"She didn't seem to care that someone was looking at her - or wondering who would end up buying the underwear she tried on."
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone would buy underwear that other people wear and haven't cleaned."
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "When she left, the shop assistant obviously had to take the underwear off the shelves, but fortunately that was the case."
"I hate to go home and buy a new pair of underwear, only to find another woman trying it on and not being cleaned."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark has been made aware of what happened inside our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9."
All defective products have been removed from the shelves.
How to Protect Yourself with Gamma in a Gun Attack
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, for advice on how to deal with gun-toting assailants at close range.
Whether he approaches you from the front or the back, the video will teach you how to turn the tables.
If the gunman approaches you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "clear the line of fire," Mizrachi said.
Then, hold the gun between your forearms and shoulders and hit the attacker in the face with your elbow.
Next he put his knee to his groin and, as the attacker bent over in pain, turned the gun in his hand and hit him in the face with the barrel and reserve gun, keeping the weapon pointed at him.
If the gunman approaches from the front, use a similar trick - keep your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and reverse the muzzle so that the gunman cannot fire.
At the same time, the weight was pressed on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, and the muzzle was turned from his clenched hand, then pointed at him.
Sounds complicated?
Check out the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, if you're not a Gamma Master, the safest way to get out of a robbery is to hand over the cash.
A rogue family destroys low-rent housing in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A rogue family evicted for intimidating neighbours caused £50,000 in damage to their low-rent accommodation before leaving.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their low-rent house in Soltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that it had been severely damaged.
The walls were full of holes, the floor was torn, the garbage was thrown all over the floor, and the walls were painted in a mess.
The family has been moving since the eviction and is said to be currently living in a private home
Donna McEvoy, housing manager for the Cornwall Housing Association, said she feared the house was beyond saving.
"It's a nightmare for the people who live here, and I don't think people can live like that," she said.
There are a lot of things to weigh in now because the house is likely to become a not so good element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are equally notorious.
The couple, who have three sons, will live here from time to time.Police said the family's terror included using baseball bats to fight in the streets, terrorising nearby residents, taking drugs, selling drugs, shouting, arguing and swearing.
The 47-year-old tenant, Skeldon, received an anti-social behaviour resolution in June.
Many of the rooms in the house, which is likely to be demolished, are long standing rubbish
The floor was lifted up in the room where the drugs had been traded
Neighbours said they were often seen fighting in the streets and often called police over it
The Cornwall Housing Society this week forcibly removed her from the residence with her husband after giving them an 11-week extension to move voluntarily.
Relaxed neighbors cheered, saying their lives had been hell on earth.
"They don't care about anyone," said one neighbor.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years and it's been so bad.
We've seen the police come to the door countless times.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We get up early because it's so quiet here - we're not used to it yet!
It's great that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association, said the family had failed to cooperate with the local government.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years and is regularly visited by police
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the overgrown side of the low-rent
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant did not take any responsibility for her behaviour with her family and the eviction was the last practice considered by the Cornwall Housing Society."
It was a very difficult case to deal with because their behaviour was so extreme and what they were doing must have been very frightening for the neighbours.
I thank my team for their work, as well as Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who have been brave enough to provide us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that we will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house at various times, but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress was also thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms after they were driven away
Housing association workers will soon clear piles of rubbish around the house
Police had searched the house in 2014 and found more than 70 tonnes of cannabis, as well as scales, drug paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and trafficking in drugs with intent.
She claimed the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
It is understood Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth after becoming homeless.
The walls of many of the rooms in the house were covered with graffiti.
Police said they would evict tenants who defied tenant rules.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continued to defy tenant rules.
"This warning is aimed at those who think their actions will not be blamed, and those who have been devastated by such actions," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police do not tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary Clinton will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is confident she will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked the confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose the man to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he predicted Hillary would pick Garland who "has some credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said Reid did not speak directly to Hillary about whether he would nominate Garland and said he was just guessing.
He heaped praise on Garland and said Hillary's team did not want to be "spoiled" by a new pick.
Garland is the chief justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for the District of Columbia.
The Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination are "favorites" and "achievers" of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Reid said.
He said Trump was unfit to be president.
Treats: Naked calendar 'both men and women love'
Treats Magazine will work with photographer David Bellemere on a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models, rather than famous nudes, for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw said earlier this year that their mostly nude magazine was different from the old-school Playboy because "the latter is for men."
And we are for women.
Obviously, he thinks the same is true of this set of calendars.
"We need to show timeless, classic nudity that makes both women and men feel comfortable, and this time it's inspired by that," Shaw said at a calendar launch.
Women will be happy to take part in the shoot because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photo applications online or in person at public recruiting sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Small sleeping sharks are the longest-living vertebrates, video report shows

French court rejects petition to demolish shops in Jungle camp
A French court has rejected a petition by the Calais government to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" refugee camp, where thousands of refugees now live.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais government argued that the French government should have the power to dismantle a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp, where people sell everything from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts and sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Office of the Governor of Calais believes that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and there are also fire and health hazards.
The humanitarian community, however, told the Court that the shops and restaurants were extremely important, as the free food provided by State-supported associations and other groups simply did not meet the growing needs of the refugees in the camp.
They claim the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille ruled there was no legal basis to evict the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said the governor of Calais's concerns were "perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean François Molla said the role of the grocers, cafes and restaurants went far beyond simply providing food to refugees who were "living in extremely dangerous conditions."
He said the places were a peaceful meeting point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites threatened with demolition is the camp's "Jungle Book Kids" cafe, which provides 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, as well as shelter advice for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the café.
A letter to the Guardian read that closing the cafe "would be a catastrophe for these children, many as young as eight."
The charity Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday predicted the number of refugees in the Jungle camp had exceeded 9,000, the highest level since the summer surge.
"The $5000 grant has relieved me of my immediate needs."
Zhou Fen, a poor girl who built stalls in Mizuo Village, Changle Township, Huayuan County, received an acceptance letter from the University of South China.
When she was worried about the cost of admission, on August 9, the Youth League County Committee gave her a timely implementation of the 5000 yuan grant.
In recent days, the county authorities have also implemented 2.838 million yuan in financial aid for more than 690 impoverished college students.
At the same time, the financial situation of families is particularly difficult, but also through the organization of social donations and other forms to help them complete their education.
This year, Hua Yuan consolidated more than 18.5 million yuan in student aid funds and raised more than 2.5 million yuan in self-financed funds, which were transferred by the financial department to real-name bank cards of poor students within the prescribed time limit.
"I thought my dad had died and my brother and I weren't going to college," she said gratefully. "I didn't think the county would solve the problem for us in time."
As of August 8, Hua Yuan has secured more than 21 million yuan in various relief funds for 13,140 impoverished students in the first half of this year.
All of the county's poor students to achieve the necessary help, the supplement.

The New South Wales government will spend 200 million Australian dollars (154 million U.S. dollars) on the biggest renovation of the famous Sydney Opera House since it was built, Xinhua reported.
The NSW government said the renovation would not change the shell shape of the opera house.
The Sydney Opera House, one of Sydney's landmark buildings, was designed by Danish architect Jon Utzon and was completed in 1973, hosting about eight million visitors a year.
Rory Jeffs, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes the Sydney Opera House will use the makeover to make it "one of the most acoustically effective concert halls in the world."

The reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation today that as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels have announced 2,470 "blacklist" cases of tax violations.
It is understood that in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation, in conjunction with the Measures for the Administration of Tax Credit, released the Measures for the Announcement of Information on Major Tax Violations.
Not only the illegal facts, legal basis and punishment of these cases will be published, but also the basic information of the illegal parties and the persons responsible for the relevant intermediary agencies will also be put on the "blacklist" to be exposed at the same time.
Quality inspection, finance, customs and other government departments have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against "blacklist" parties.

"Environmental problems manifest themselves in air, water and soil pollution, but the roots are still in the way of production and life," he said.
For example, land development in Jiangsu Province reached 21 per cent in 2015, ranking it as the highest in the country's provinces and autonomous regions.
As a result, the problems of high pollution, large energy sources, and more land occupation have not been fundamentally addressed from the shift in production and life style.
On the one hand, Jiangsu Province from the creation of various types of ecological environment at all levels, with absolute advantage ranked first in the country; but on the other hand, the resources and environment to bear the pressure.
To promote the protection and treatment of ecological environment in a down-to-earth manner, it is necessary to fundamentally advance the transformation of production and life style and promote the transformation of people's lives through the construction of ecological civilization.

Qingdao is the 12th in China and the first pilot city of paid use and trading of emission rights in Shandong Province.
11, a number of enterprises came to Qingdao Municipal Emission Trading Center to submit applications for the purchase of emission rights, purchase acceptance will pay a fee.
The transaction is about to complete the first single also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot work officially kicked off, which will be the province's emissions trading first single and the first nationwide city-level emissions trading.
On the morning of November 11, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. came to Qingdao Emission Trading Center to submit the application for emission rights.
The enterprise is located in the old city of Qingdao plant at the end of last year to stop production, environmental protection moved to the new plant in Pingdu.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the environmental impact statement of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao Municipal Emission Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began the preliminary examination of the application materials.
According to Qingdao prices, finance and other departments to determine the collection standards, the current estimate of the initial emission rights usage fee of about 6412,000 yuan, staff will be completed within seven working days approved.
The transaction is about to complete the first single also indicates that Qingdao emission trading pilot work officially kicked off, will also be the province's emission trading first single and the first national city-level emissions trading.
Zhao Xiuping said: At present, enterprises have invested 400 million in environmental protection, a huge amount on the surface, but the concept of business management, social benefits have a great impact on enterprise innovation and management has also opened up space.
On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xinchengzhizhuo Bus Accessories Co., Ltd. has also come to the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior fittings projects to purchase emission rights.
The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprises, the application for the initial emission of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year.
The paid use and trade of air pollutant emission rights supply key industrial enterprises for the power and heat production of the whole city.
Existing units that have obtained an EIA prior to January 1, 2016, will not be charged a toll fee for the time being.
"Paid access to emission permits is not the same as access to the power of illegal discharge of pollutants, and can not randomly discharge pollutants."
Hanhongyan, deputy director of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if the illegal discharge of pollutants, excessive discharge of pollutants still have to be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to evade punishment by purchasing emission rights.
In other words, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution, thereby protecting the environment and protecting public health.
Now enterprises for their own interests, improve the enthusiasm of pollution control, cherish the limited emission rights, reduce the emission of pollutants.
Driven by the economic benefits, reducing the emission of pollutants will change from the government's compulsory behavior to the enterprise's conscious market behavior, so as to truly achieve the goal of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health.
Emission right, also called "emission right", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government according to law.
This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from the environmental capacity resources.
Next, under the premise that the total amount of pollutants discharged does not exceed the permitted amount, the amount of pollutants discharged is adjusted by means of currency exchange between the internal pollution sources.
Since the emission trading was proposed by American economist Dales in 1968, it has been applied to the management of air and river pollution sources in the United States since the 1970s.
China began to pilot in 2007, has been Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other 14 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) in full implementation.
To assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, a number of Russian warplanes have been lifted from the Hermeimim airbase in Syria to provide support, the Russian Defense Ministry said.
On 22 February this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, which has been in effect since 27 February.
Under the agreement, the cease-fire does not include military strikes against terrorist groups designated by the UN Security Council, such as the Islamic State's Support Front.
Russia will continue to build relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian military personnel will be guaranteed accordingly.
Without a crackdown on extremist forces, he added, they would spread to Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not reached an agreement to jointly combat extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen cooperation in this regard with Syria, Iran, Iraq and other parties.
In September 2015, Russia began a military strike against extremist forces in Syria at the invitation of the Syrian government.
March 15 this year, the main Russian military forces in Syria began to withdraw, but the Russian side pledged to continue to maintain the Hermeimim air base and naval base in Tartus.
In the case of the rebirth of the old house and the successful township creation, He Peijun has done a good example: Inheriting a century-old house, but also telling the story of the inheritance of a piece of land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people a year gather at Chushan, either to bring a variety of ideas or to find inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the country and the city should be mutual companionship, just like mother and child, there is no strong or weak, there is no need for anyone to rule whom, should be very warm.
There is no fixed pattern of rural development, but it is extremely difficult to rely on rural spontaneous change, the most important point should be to let the right people go to the countryside.
Traffic authorities in Shanghai's Songjiang district have seized more than 30 cases a week using electronic police to crack down on drivers playing with their mobile phones while driving.
With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones more and more fun, Twitter, and even play games, Taobao has become the norm, many people seem to be inseparable from the mobile phone, even when driving can not stop.
The Road Traffic Safety Act explicitly prohibits playing with a mobile phone while driving and defines it as "an act that interferes with safe driving."
Unfortunately, due to the large number of offenders, difficulties in obtaining evidence and other reasons, this phenomenon has not been punished properly, the legal provisions have become almost a display.
If the authorities can all resolve to "declare war" on driving and playing with mobile phones and normalise the measure, the offence will surely be curbed.
It is necessary to keep a close watch on the management of household registration files, and to establish electronic and paper files one by one on the materials of household registration for persons without household registration, so as to ensure that the records are complete and effective.
The public security organ shall inform the relevant departments in a timely manner about the registration of persons without household registration.
Policy measures that are inconsistent with the spirit of the present Implementation Opinions will be subject to a centralized clean-up, a serious revision of the amendment, and a resolute repeal of the repeal.
Wang Xuefen, 48, was taking workers to spray pear trees in a collective shed in the village of Donglin, Taicang City.
The village of 150 acres of orchards, more than 10 tree species, only 12 workers plus a technical engineer.
Last year fifty thousand dollars altogether, like my age, if you work in the factory certainly can't get this money.
Last year, Donglin village income reached 22 million yuan, of which the total income from agriculture accounted for nearly half.
Village Secretary Su Qifang: Per capita land acreage is rising every year, just 50 acres, now more than 100 acres; per acre efficiency is increasing every year, the income of professional farmers have room for growth every year.
Shares are quantified to every villager, the biggest bright spot of rural collective economic reform in southern Jiangsu is to clarify the property rights of rural collective operating assets and explore the separation of politics and economics.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations in Anzhen Street, Xishan District, Wuxi City "split account management" with their village committees, which perform rural public affairs management, while the cooperative organizations are mainly engaged in operation.
The two institutions have two sets of accounts and do not "tie up boundaries" with each other, so as to prevent corruption from occurring in the participation of village cadres in the management of collective assets.
Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of Agriculture, said that Jiangsu will continue to push forward the reform of the community joint-stock cooperation system in the next step, encouraging farmers to develop jointly and establishing a mechanism for the operation of democratic power at the village level.
Zhu Baoping: Further push forward the reform, engage in community joint-stock cooperation, quantify the assets to the members, fixed to the farmers, to form a clear property rights.
Through the Internet +, the implementation of his right to know, the right to participate in decision-making and supervision of democratic management, the implementation of the three rights to farmers, indeed let it become a standard operating mechanism of joint-stock cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy in the rural areas of southern Jiangsu has mainly formed four development models: asset leasing, enterprise shareholding, agricultural development and joint development.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "beautiful hand" began shooting career path several "reversal"
Zhang Donghong of Dongyuan Village, Xiang'an District, Xiamen, replaced his 29-inch old TV with a 65-inch one just a few days ago.
The daughter of an ordinary farmer is Zhang Binbin, who won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter rifle three-position final for China at the Rio Olympics on Monday night.
11 night, just in front of this new TV, Zhang Donghong couple and dozens of relatives and close friends, together witnessed the daughter all the way to catch up, from almost preliminary elimination to almost a major reversal of the magical process.
In that day's competition, Zhang Binbin once ranked in the middle and lower reaches, seems to be very far away from the final.
But the parents and friends did not give up, kept brushing the text live, see with the other players finished, Zhang Binbin all the way up the ranking, eventually locked up the final seat, his home immediately erupted from a burst of cheers.
In the final, Zhang Binbin was once ranked in the situation, the last few shots more and more stable, only 0.2 ring behind the champion to win the silver medal.
Zhang, now 27, has nearly missed the hard-won silver medal on several occasions in his 16 years of shooting.
Zhang Xiaolong, his mother, told reporters that while they hesitated, Zhang Binbin sought out a few "novelists" from the same village.
These "novelists" were the same village children who had been recommended for training at the same time, among them Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin and once again because of family difficulties and other reasons, take the initiative to return to the school in Xiang'an.
But after his enlightenment coach Zhang Yajie did the work repeatedly, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin and because of the delay into the national team, once because there was no hope and returned home again.
This time, not only coach Zhang Yajie, Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and Fujian Province team leaders and coaches came to the home, and eventually persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Just as yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl with the stick to achieve a shooting on the road to a reversal.
"Every coach selects his players in a different way. When I saw Benny's hands were so beautiful, I hit it off."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, her daughter, although not the best results, but hit the ring number is stable, which is an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.
In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie was most impressed by the input of the peasant girl.
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen Shooting Team, the team carried out a standing practice of raising guns and asked the team members not to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved children, from a young age like painting and homemade handmade toys,
"Originally I would make clothes at home, sewing, Binbin would pick up some scraps to make their own dolls."
She says her daughter often sews her own handmade toys, and with her expertise in drawing, she makes them come alive, from the doll's features to her clothing.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family gathered less and more, only the holidays to go home, usually by telephone contact.
Parents said, whether it is to meet or call, Zhang Binbin rarely said their hard work, more with their parents to talk about some happy things.
Usually can not see his daughter, parents at home will be his daughter's childhood paintings as well as the honor of the calendar year are carefully stored.
Zhang showed his daughter's animated cartoon to reporters, "If she hadn't been a shooter, she should have continued to draw."
And in the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's home, there is a cupboard full of medals, medals and certificates she has received.
Zhang Donghong neatly placed the medals and medals, certificates are unified into the folder preservation, "these are Binbin more than ten years of hard work in exchange for the honor, we all cherish."

Hong Kong's Oriental Daily reported on August 12, the current mainland diamond sales are alleged to exist in three major problems, including false diamond clarity to push up prices, false diamond weight, after-sale insecurity and so on.
And Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centres, with local artisans renowned for their diamond-cutting skills, and the diamonds sold are highly qualified and popular with mainland women.
"A small cloth bag, held in the palm of your hand, a light handful, worth nearly a million dollars," said a woman surnamed Liu, who was involved in the purchase of diamonds, describing to mainland media her experience in Antwerp in June this year.
She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, carried them to the toilet and shower for days on end, and was nervous about walking and sleeping.
She claims that diamonds bought in Antwerp cost about $55,000 per carat, while diamonds of the same quality retail at about $111,000 in Xiamen.
A few days ago, she sold all the diamonds on her behalf at a 20% mark-up, making a profit of $200,000 at a time.
According to the Mainland Customs, diamonds are not articles or necessities for passengers in their itinerary and therefore fall under the category of goods. They are required to be declared at the time of entry and exit. Otherwise, they may be classified as smuggling. In serious cases, they are liable to imprisonment.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is to spend her summer holidays in Switzerland, Britain's prime minister Downing Street announced Wednesday, without giving details of where she will take her leave, foreign media reported.
Media captionIn the wake of the British referendum on Brexit, Britain's new prime minister chose to take a holiday in Switzerland, a "neutral country" on the continent, with some sort of policy symbolism.
The Guardian commented that the symbolism represented by Switzerland as a neutral country played a role in the choice of the British prime minister's first holiday destination.
The Daily Telegraph review noted that Theresa May chose to holiday in Switzerland, the first time a British prime minister has visited the country since Mrs Thatcher.
The choice of two female prime ministers contrasts with the two male prime ministers, Tony Blair and David Cameron, who prefer to spend their holidays in hotter places.
It is understood that Theresa May, Britain's new prime minister, will return to London on August 24, after which she is awaited by a series of important jobs and events.
The British Parliament will resume on 5 September to debate topics including an online request to hold a second Brexit referendum.
Brexit was decided by a British referendum on 23 June, but the new British prime minister is unwilling to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on member states' Brexit by the end of the year.

China's Mars program is here.
China's Mars exploration mission to achieve a surround, landing, patrol, this form has never been abroad.
China's Mars exploration and launch target is a step around, landing, patrol, this task is quite difficult.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working closely on engineering plans to launch our country's first Mars rover in this window by 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although China's spacecraft has entered deep space, but the completion of the Mars exploration mission is still indispensable, Mars exploration means that China from the real sense into the era of deep space exploration.
"Every two or three years, there is only one chance for Mars to be closest to Earth, and launching a Mars rover at this point in time is the most energy-efficient for a launch vehicle," he said.
"Taking into account the quality of the Mars rover, China will be the Long March V launch vehicle to complete the mission."
China's Mars exploration mission to achieve a surround, landing, patrol, this form has never been in foreign countries, once planned to achieve a surround and landing, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical fields, the special thing is that although the Mars rover is a space probe, but compared with the general space probe, it has distinct characteristics.
That is to say, the Mars rover should have the ability to determine the route and discover the danger of obstacles.
Pang Zhihao, a researcher at the Fifth Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, said that the reason why people are so interested in Mars exploration is because it has important scientific, technological and other significance, and even concerns the future of mankind.
Mars has now become the most highly studied planet outside of Earth, and the history of human exploration of Mars using space probes runs through almost the entire history of human spaceflight.
As a result, humans hope to one day establish a base of habitation on Mars and eventually emigrate to Mars, turning it into a second home for humanity.
There are also plenty of signs that Mars, like Earth today, may well have evolved over billions of years to look like a thinner atmosphere, cooler temperatures and depleted water sources.
So a probe or manned landing on Mars for research could come up with a plan to prevent Earth from turning into a second Mars that would be difficult for humans to survive.
As of June 2016, there were 114 lunar expeditions and 43 Mars explorations worldwide.
Since the 1990s, however, there have been 18 missions to Mars, compared with 14 to the moon.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers in operation, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are in operation.
The world's space powers have plans to target the Martian system, showing that today's Mars exploration is hotter than lunar exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars rover, Mangarian, becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
"Mangarian" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, to explore whether there is methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult part of the mission was that the rover had only one chance to enter the Martian atmosphere with its aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration
The Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges, according to Sun Zezhou, chief designer of the Mars rover in the general department of the Fifth Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
Mars has a very low atmospheric pressure, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, with a high degree of uncertainty.
Scientists do not yet have a thorough understanding of factors such as its variability and storm-time characteristics.
Dust storms, similar to dust storms on Earth, often form on Mars in the summer, causing the rover to receive a sharp drop in solar energy, and a "sleep" pattern must be devised for the rover to patiently wait for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a diminishing effect on solar illumination, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars exploration.
This requires the probe's solar wing to be larger and constantly adjusted in an effort to align it in the direction of the sun.
Moreover, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38% of that of Earth, but much more so than the surface gravity of the moon, so the probe needs more power.
"The most central and difficult part of this mission is the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration of the rover as it enters the Martian atmosphere.
Sun said the whole process could not be controlled by the ground in real time because of the distance between the Earth and Mars, so it had to be done autonomously by the rover.
Since there is not so much propellant to offset that high speed, deceleration on landing on Mars depends on the action of the Martian atmosphere, which is difficult to simulate on the ground.
In general, the way to explore Mars is similar to the way to explore the moon, Pang said, and is also to "circle, fall, patrol, and return," ultimately achieving the goal of a manned landing on Mars.
Because Mars is much further away from Earth than the moon, exploring Mars requires tackling a series of more complex technical hurdles.
Taiwan's "Executive Premier" Lin Quan announced yesterday morning that "regulations governing the improper acquisition of property by political parties and their affiliated organizations" will take effect from today, according to Taiwanese media reports.
Zhan Qixian, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, said: "A Kuomintang with more than 100 years of history, with the commitment and responsibility of the community, will not go bankrupt in this way."
Lin stressed that if political parties, affiliated organizations or trustees violate the prohibition against punishment stipulated in the regulations, the committee will investigate ex officio and punish them "in accordance with the law."
Lin also announced that he would not be the vice chairman of the party's property committee, and that Hung Pei-kan, Taiwan's "deputy director of the Independent Commission Against Corruption," would take up the post.
He said that Gu Lixiong as the chairman of the inappropriate party property committee is the only candidate, drawing on Hong Bacon's past experience in inspecting relevant major cases, will serve as the basis for the committee to investigate relevant cases of improper party property.
Jen Chih-hsien believes that as long as there are still party properties today, no one will give you social donations. If all party properties are confiscated and taken away, the Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship.
Zhan Qi-xian also stressed that even if the improper party property regulations on the road, the Kuomintang party property has not been completely confiscated, confiscated, the rest will still be donated as promised, so that the party will return to zero, the party to start from scratch.
Original title: "Corridor Doctor" Lan Yuefeng v CCTV presenter Wang Zhian reputation tort first instance lost
Legal Evening News Lan Yuefeng took Wang Zhian and Beijing Weimeng Chuangke Network Technology Co. Ltd. to court over comments made by CCTV host Wang Zhian on Sina Weibo about the incident of the "corridor doctor."

12 Watch: Athletics kick-off China is busy women's football team rushed four bicycles hoping for a breakthrough
Cycling is on track for a "zero breakthrough" in Olympic gold, while the women's soccer girls will challenge two-time world champion Germany in anticipation of a blowout into the top four.
Wang has been in outstanding form for the last two seasons, winning a silver medal at last year's Beijing Athletics World Championships and upgrading the individual event title at the group walk world championships in May.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old South Korean archer Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the women's archery individual event and won the Olympic gold medal after the team event, becoming the double champion.
Zhang Huizhen, considered a late-bloomer, stood proudly on the podium of the Rio Olympics after she regretted not getting a ticket to the last Olympics in London.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal by beating Germany's Lisa Onlu 6-2 in the final of the women's archery individual event at the Samba Boulevard Stadium in Rio, Brazil.
She did not shoot her first arrow until she was in fourth grade in primary school, and was a latecomer to fame when she won her first individual gold medal at the World Cup in 2014, aged 27.
"There wasn't a level before high school," recalls Zhang, "that made it impossible to compete across the country.
Zhang Huizhen, who finished fourth in the London Olympic trials four years ago, regretted losing her Olympic ticket and had to watch her colleague and friend Chi-fu win two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen said of winning the gold medal after the award ceremony of the women's archery individual contest. "Up to the end it was shooting as many arrows as possible, which may have brought good results and satisfaction.
Kifubi, a 28-year-old South Korean archer and gold medalist in the individual archery competition at the London Olympics, won the bronze medal.

Although it hasn't been confirmed, numerous sources have said Apple's fall 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
Apple didn't respond, but word has spread about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even pictures of the iPhone 7's "real model" are available online.
The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching," hot, tight, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy genuine first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning.
This added to the disappointment over the new phone. "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks."
The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, comes with countless secrets before it's born.
Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which will give Apple room to add a second speaker.
Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface.
The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch.
But that hasn't stopped industry insiders from betting on the iPhone 7, which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone line.
Though the iPhone's market share has slipped, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts believe the iPhone 7 will reap a historic sales performance.
Meanwhile, Bocom CEO Hock Tan said Apple's future revenue growth is likely to be more than 20 percent, thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent who planned to buy the iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who own an iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy an iPhone 7, a significant proportion.
Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation.
About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to statistics.
Media captionTaiwan was hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "The damage to TSMC's production facilities is beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7."
Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first low price to start with the genuine iPhone 7.
According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply.
The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring users lower prices and more intimate services.
"At the lowest price, consumers may be able to buy the iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day."
With plenty of supply and a variety of offers, buying the iPhone 7 is no longer a "mountain of stress," and Suning's logistics will turn that beauty into a more intuitive experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."
The organizers hope that through the exhibition of cultural relics, the local people will learn more about the time-honored Chinese culture, thus enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Barcelona's "Ming Dynasty Cultural Relics Exhibition" is part of a European tour that will run until the beginning of October.

The Rio Olympics "Green Pool incident has come under scrutiny in recent days as the water in the diving pool turned from blue to green, foreign media reported.
However, water from the water polo match pool adjacent to the diving pool also turned green on the morning of Oct.
The Australian water polo player said after the match that his eyes were tingling and he wanted to shed tears.
Earlier, Rio Olympic officials confirmed the pool turned green and said the discoloration was due to a weakening of the alkalinity and would not affect the athletes' physical health.
But after winning a match against Japan in a water polo pool, Australian athletes said their eyes were tingling.
After the water in the diving pool turned green at the earliest, the competition organizers worked overtime on the night of 9 to deal with the problem, but on the morning of 10 found that the color of the water polo pool also changed rapidly.
The water polo pool's environmental conditions deteriorated during Australia's match against Japan, but officials stressed they would restore the water quality of both pools to its original color on Nov.
"The water in the diving pool was the first to weaken in alkalinity yesterday afternoon," Rio Olympic spokesman Mario Andrada said.
"We learned about a number of possible causes of discoloration and the alkalinity of the water."
The water sports centre has carried out a series of tests and hundreds of divers and swimmers have used the pool to make sure the conditions are up to standard.
"We've been following normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the impact more athletes can have on water quality," he said.
"But a change in the colour of the water certainly has no effect on health, especially for athletes," he said.
"This independent team confirmed our assessment and the steps we have taken to restore the pool to its normal colour and chemical condition."
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the pace of recovery was affected by the rain," he said.

Urumqi Standardizes the Operation Order of Tourist FIT Market Travel Agencies Must Sign Contracts with Tourists
At present, Xinjiang has entered the tourist season, in order to regulate the order of the tourism retail market, the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment of the joint City Administration of Transportation Law Enforcement Detachment yesterday on the retail market in the presence of non-standard tourist vehicles, travel agencies and tourists signed a contract with the low rate and other issues were investigated and dealt with.
At eight o'clock yesterday morning, around the Kempinski Hotel, there were about 10 buses full of tourists, most of them individual groups heading to Tianchi for a day trip.
Hello, I'm from Urumqi Tourism Bureau. Have you signed a contract with this travel agency?
Urumqi transportation bureau law enforcement detachment staff Yu Bin said: "off-site coach and bus line in the Urumqi market operating tourism passenger transport projects, no qualifications."
"Operating beyond the scope of this penalty 30 to 100,000 fine, the driver without a license is a fine of 2,000 yuan."
It is understood that the city of Urumqi tourism law enforcement authorities have previously checked the West Park, Red Hill and other places where tourists are concentrated.
"The first is safety, the second is regulation," said Ma Qi, deputy chief of Urumqi's tourism law enforcement detachment. "There are no minor problems with tourist vehicles.

On the morning of August 12, the Information Office of the State Council held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
Sheng Laiyun, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and director of the General Statistics Department of the National Economy, said that the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed in July, but it was still operating in a reasonable range.
Figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics show that the growth rate of fixed-asset investment and total imports fell in July.
Sheng Laiyun said: With regard to the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a phrase once spoken by the premier: "The situation is fluctuating, and the situation is still improving," which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that the "volatility" refers to the July growth rate of some economic indicators is indeed down.
As the domestic and foreign economies were still undergoing deep adjustment in July, the international situation was complex and volatile, and the recovery of the world economy was less than expected, the pressure on exports was still relatively strong.
Domestically, the economy as a whole is still at a critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is releasing and the economy is under considerable downward pressure, so some indicators fluctuate somewhat.
Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there is a special case in July, the floods are more serious, high temperature and hot weather on some areas of production and operation brought some impact.
According to information recently released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people across the country have been affected by the disaster, with direct economic losses exceeding 200 billion yuan.
In terms of industrial, investment and transportation-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The growth rate of goods turnover in July fell 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, with flooding having an impact on traffic in those areas.
Judging from these factors, it is also normal and expected that some indicators will fluctuate in July.
He said the "momentum is still good" refers to the fact that although the economic growth rate has slowed down, but the overall smooth operation of the economy, steady progress, stable trend for the better has not changed.
CPI rose 1.8 per cent in July, up 0.2 per cent month-on-month, and 2.1 per cent in January-July, so prices are generally stable.
According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal to the high temperature of the counties statistics, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.
At least 28 provinces across the country have now defined the rates, although the rates vary from province to province, while Chongqing receives its high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance.
For those above 35 ° C and below 37 ° C, it shall be issued at a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; for those above 37 ° C, it shall be issued at a rate of not less than 15 yuan per person per day.
High temperature workers above 40 ℃ are entitled to a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day (except for those workers who have already enjoyed the post allowance for high temperature operation in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, last month, the heaviest days of Kaizhou can receive 330 yuan, the fewest days of the city is 80 yuan, and the heaviest temperature of Youyang due to not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units would offset the high temperature allowance with refreshing drinks. The City Safety Supervision Bureau said that this practice was not in line with the current practice.
The employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers if they stop working or shorten their working hours due to the hot weather.
The city's social service bureau said employees who have not received a high temperature allowance for working in high temperatures can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the business is located, or call 12333 to lodge a complaint.
If an employing unit refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the department in charge of human resources and social security at or above the county level in the place where the employee is employed.
At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in the total salary and deducted from the tax.
The high temperature allowance is therefore not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash, not in kind, such as drinks.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the high-speed rail section of Urumqi, with an overall construction area of about 100,000 square meters.
The first and second floors above ground are the depot, waiting room and office and commercial premises, and the first basement is the outbound floor.
At present, Urumqi station is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, integrating high-speed rail, rail transit, public transport, rental and so on, which can achieve seamless docking of various modes of transfer.
There are three ticket halls on the north and south sides of the platform level and on the north side of the departure level, equipped with 39 manual ticket windows and 34 automatic ticketing machines.

Tickets are now available for both stations, and the train journey time between them is around 10 minutes. Passengers need to pay attention to the specific station names of the ticket's departure and terminal.
The official commissioning of the new passenger station in Urumqi will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national comprehensive transportation city, and promote the construction of the "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the new district.
Gracia is a budding female toucan with the scent of a tropical rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name.
At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, recovering from her surgery, showed off her new 3D printed plastic beak.
The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life.
This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it.
Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak.
To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material.
Outside the bill is a thin layer of horny sheath, hollow inside, with only a few thin bony struts crisscrossed.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged.
The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her.
Now Gracia has become adept at using her new beak to drink, eat, and even peck up tiny grains.
"The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print."
"3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into our lives," Thomas Lange, chairman of SG3D Printing, told Xinhua.
Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was found on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015.
At that time its upper beak was brutally broken by a group of young men, and it was completely unable to eat and was in critical condition.
The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flood of calls against animal cruelty in Costa Rica and beyond after media reports.
There are calls for stricter animal protection laws and stronger penalties for abusers.
People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia recover as much as possible from her pre-injury life.
Even the inventor of 3D printing technology, Chuck Herr, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak.
"The case of Gracia is unique in that the rest of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak."
"We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak.
"This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Lange told Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia touched the hearts of renowned documentary director Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman.
They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month.
The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself and engage its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.
Core tip: Japanese oil companies in particular are wary of the rise of small, independent Chinese refineries known as "teapots."
BEIJING, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's largest oil company, JX Energy, believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn.
Japanese oil companies in particular have expressed alarm over the rise of China's small, independent refineries, known as "teapots."
The quality of China's oil products is approaching that of Japan as the Chinese government tightens environmental regulations.
Before obtaining permission to import crude oil, "teapot refineries" generally import heavy oils with high sulphur content from places such as Russia for refining.
The production of petroleum products with high sulfur content and poor oil quality has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining permission to import crude oil, Teapot Refinery was able to import Omani crude and Russian crude with low sulfur content, and the quality of its petroleum products also improved.
"As China's domestic standards for the quality of its oil products continue to improve, so does the capacity of its refining equipment," the company said.
As a result, the quality of Chinese oil products exported abroad has gradually reached the same level as that of Japan, which is the highest quality in the world.
"After the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia," JX Energy said, competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although “Japanese premium oil ” is facing a crisis, Japanese oil companies have responded only by“ keeping an eye on the market while exporting to profitable regions ”.
There has also been growing interest in teapot refineries as Chinese exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market.
The 2016 Yangzi Evening News Liqun Sunshine Aid campaign, launched on May 26, brought the total number of poor students applying for grants to more than 800 after two months of registration.
In the process, more than 1.2 million yuan has been donated by the community (which has been announced in five batches) to help at least 240 poor students realize their dream university.

Li Qun, a well-known charity brand in China, has sponsored more than 4,000 poor students since 2003 in Jiangsu Province.
The scope of funding for this activity is the university entrance examination for undergraduate students, not including tuition free professional; excellent character, family poverty.
The Bureau of Statistics said New Zealand's population growth had previously been just over 2 per cent in 1974 and at the peak of the "baby boom" population in the 1950s and early 1960s.
New Zealand's net inflow of migrants in the 12 months to June was 691,000, making it the main driver of population growth in recent years.
Also, the natural increase in New Zealand's population over the same time period was 28.2 million.
In the last 10 years, the average annual net inflow of immigrants to New Zealand has been 218,000, and the average annual natural population growth has been 323,000, according to the data.
Demographically, the influx of migrants has meant a gradual increase in the proportion of "working-age people" between the ages of 15 and 39.
New Zealand's working-age population grew 3.6 percent to 1.58 million in the 12 months to June 2016.
At the same time, the elderly population over the age of 65 increased by the same 3.6% to 700,000.

The ultraviolet ray not only lets the schoolmate's skin blacken, will burn the skin more, how lets the skin be able to pass through the military training smoothly, does not get sunburned?
Sunscreen packaging is generally marked SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sun protection index, is for UVB ultraviolet rays, our common SPF index has 15, 30, 50 and so on.
The products labeled PA are for UVA, which makes sunscreens more effective. Typically, the strength of PA is expressed as +, and an additional + indicates an extended period of effective protection.
Oily skin should choose strong penetration of water-based sunscreen products, sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose frost-like sunscreen products; neutral skin generally no strict regulations, sensitive skin rub on any care products are a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, as it takes time for the product to fully penetrate into the skin.
Military training sun time is longer, sunscreen wipe every two hours to have a lasting effect, do not be lazy.
As the skin has just been stimulated by the sun, military training back do not immediately use whitening products.
After military training exposure, if conditions can be used towels wrapped with ice to cool the burned skin to slow local dryness and heat.
Farmers who buy agricultural machinery during the exhibition period continue to apply the cumulative subsidy policy, with farmers receiving up to 40 per cent of the subsidy for purchasing agricultural machinery.
The exhibition is aimed at attracting investment from all over the world. In particular, it has increased its invitation to countries along the "One Belt, One Road" and countries in the target market.
This exhibition strives to complete the investment contract project 60, the introduction of 22 billion yuan, signed more than 160 trade contracts, the contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.

"Xiang Expo" has become an important platform for fostering the development of local specialty industries and pushing them out of the country.
On some nights, the ionosphere is filled with free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in replicating the effect, according to the August 11 report on the popular science website.
While an ionosphere with a steady stream of free electrons could help people listen to a university radio station on the edge of its range, that may not be the Air Force's interest.
The ionosphere, which is filled with electrons, means that the radio used by the military has a greater range of transmissions, and it may provide some protection against solar storms for Global Positioning System (GPS) signals.
The ultimate goal could be to create a series of CubeSats on demand that could strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, the teams that signed the contracts with the Air Force had to prove that the scientific principles would work.
Industry data show that total coal production capacity in 2015 was nearly 6 billion tons, with a national surplus of 1.8 billion tons of coal capacity.
Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five times before and after the elimination of excess and backward production capacity notice.
Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, but the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
Between November last year and January, Qinhuangdao's 5,500 kilocalories of thermal coal prices hovered at a low of 370 yuan / ton for a long time, with 90 percent of coal companies in the red.
And since February, coal prices have gradually recovered, the recent Qinhuangdao power coal prices are rising for four consecutive weeks, rose to a 16-month high, once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As prices have picked up, concerns have arisen over whether a number of small coal mines will return to work and production.
In this regard, China (Hainan) Reform and Development Research Institute, Director of the Institute of Economics Kuang Xianming carried out analysis and interpretation.
Kuang Xianming: To capacity has aroused great concern from all sides, today's announcement of the coal industry to capacity of the report card also really let everyone feel more worried.
These three superficial factors still reflect the reason why the transformation of our growth pattern has lagged behind in the past, that is, the government-led growth pattern has not yet been fundamentally transformed.
Second, it is also directly related to the promotion of local governments. In the process of capacity removal, funds and corresponding supporting measures should be put in place. From this perspective, the differences between different regions are indeed relatively large.
Third, some provinces that are currently at a slower pace may be at greater risk if they are to catch up in the second half of the year.
In this case, relying on central incentive funds to advance the process of capacity removal may have a certain negative impact.
First, the removal of capacity is not simply a matter of total volume control.
Our aim is to reconfigure the new format of the entire coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity and promoting the optimization of the structure.
In the process of deploying desalination capacity, local governments must combine desalination capacity with the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry and vigorously develop related service industries.
Second, in order to complete this year's desalination task within this year, we still have to give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we should strengthen the undercover role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to the issue of employment, so we should strengthen the employment skills training for employees and workers.
"The decline is due to the deterioration in foreign investment expectations for Brazil's GDP growth over the medium term."
Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7 percent in 2015, down from 5.7 percent in 2014.
The Credit Suisse International Investment Attraction Index consists of four sub-indices: infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and volume of direct investment.
International direct investment in Brazil was $64.6 billion in 2015, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, "greenfield investment" in Brazil (the investment model for setting up factories abroad) was $17.9 billion, down 2.1 per cent year-on-year.
"There are 288 'greenfield investments' in Brazil, compared with an annual average of 314 between 2003 and 2014," he said.
However, international direct investment in Brazil has reached $33.8 billion in the first half of 2016, an increase of almost 10 percent compared to the same period last year.

The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to Dreiver's home before police arrived.
Canadian police said at a news conference Wednesday that the information they received included "martyrdom videos" from the FBI about the youth who was about to carry out the attack.
On video, a man wearing a black balaclava was reading the Koran, mentioning crimes against Muslims and vowing to attack a Canadian city soon, Deutsche Welle reported.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours and during peak hours.
The incident is the first time police have shot a terror suspect before the incident since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year.
After the upgrading of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channel old Wanfu River, Beidaliao Channel from September 1 to collect tolls.
These two tributary waterways adopt the social financing way to carry on the reconstruction construction, the charge has been approved by the provincial government related department.
Old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, Yutai, through Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, the total length of 32.5 kilometers.
According to the need of navigation, the old Wanfu River channel adopted the way of maintenance and transformation, dredged the depth of local water, cut the sharp bend, and so on, and the navigation conditions were improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Rencheng District, through the Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, a total length of 19 kilometers.
The reconstruction of the two waterways began in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015, with the investment, construction and operation of Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center as the main body.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction, fee repayment", Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center collects waterway tolls according to the toll standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
Among them, the basic toll by 1.75 yuan / ton of dead weight, mileage toll by 0.05 yuan / ton of dead weight.
Tolls will be collected from 15 June 2016 until 14 June 2019.
The reporter learned from the port and navigation bureau of jining that there are currently four toll channels in jining, namely, the soshui river channel, the baima river channel, the beidaliu channel, the old wanfu river channel.
The four waterways are tributaries of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which are upgraded by means of social financing.
Su-Shui River waterway upgrading project is the first to adopt the "government + market" model, for the construction of port infrastructure projects in Shandong Province, the Government accounted for the main investment, social funds to supplement the funding gap.
The feeder waterways such as Baima River, Laowanfu River and Beidaliuhe River adopt the mode of pure market operation.
The funds allocated by the state finance can not meet the needs of engineering construction and restrict the progress of waterway upgrading.
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure in line with the requirements of national policy, but also become the way to crack the funding bottleneck.
Ning's performance in the 100m freestyle semi-final has left many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50m freestyle preliminaries, Ning Zetao once again refreshed people's "bottom line."
In fact, the 50m freestyle is not the main event Ning Zetao, his performance at the World Championships in Kazan and the best results, also decided that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in this event.
Sure enough, the Ta Kung Pao, an authoritative Hong Kong media outlet, revealed that the biggest reason for Ning's loss was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors off the field may have had a big impact on his thinking about the future, and he may now be more interested in moving into the entertainment industry.
After the world championships in Kazan, Ning Zetao became an instant net red thanks to his super high Yan value and good results.
So, "national husband", "small fresh meat", "pattern beautiful male" and so on address also continuously become the label on his body.
A variety of commercial activities come to the door, a good money, become a golden twinkling Avenue.
In this case, Ning Zetao, even if he chooses to retire at this time to join the entertainment industry, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable path.
After all, he is only 23 years old, after a certain amount of learning, can rely on its popularity to star in a TV series or two.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he has enough qualifications compared with those of his predecessors.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Liu Xuan, 21, had reached the end of his career as an athlete.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered and laid the foundation for her future foray into the entertainment industry.
After retiring, Liu Xuan appeared in a number of TV series and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in two Olympic Games in the single-double 10m platform competition, and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the individual 10m platform competition at the 2004 Olympics, Tian Liang's athletic performance slipped and he was blown out of the diving team.
And his participation with his daughter in variety shows such as "Where's Dad Going?" has made him even more eye-catching.
Once the golden generation of gymnastics Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participate in a variety of high-profile programs.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiaopeng at that time led China to win the 2008 Olympic Games men's team champion, Yang Wei has twice won the individual all-around gold medal, known as the all-around king.
And Chen has become the king of the rings while leading China to the 2012 Olympic team title.
And Chen's magnanimous move, after he suffered a miscarriage of justice at the London Olympics and a painful loss of his gold medal, has left him in the doghouse.
But the main energy for these athletes is still in the arena, and for variety shows, it's just a touch and go.
But whether retired or active athletes, to be able to get the favor of the entertainment industry need to have to take the results as a guarantee.
After all, the athlete steps into a new field, regardless of ability or human relations, is a blank state.
Even for "old people" like Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, who have been mixed up in the entertainment industry for many years, ordinary viewers mention them and still think more about their performance at the Olympics.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other newcomers, in the variety show appearance of the introduction, without exception, are "Olympic champion."
Compared with the above several people, Ning Zetao a swimming world championships title is still slightly thin.
What's more, compared to the achievements of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, if Ning Zetao at the age of 23, a slight setback in his sports career on the precipitous retreat, the negative impact on his image is probably incalculable.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people are asking for "not to win a hundred battles, but to be fearless," and Ning Zettao is a long way from that.
Back 10,000 steps, said Ning Ze Tao handsome, can rely on Yan value to obtain the support of thousands of brain powder.
No point power, only rely on appearance, want to mix well in the entertainment industry, this difficulty is not better than good training to get back to the state it should be difficult.
The road of life choice depends entirely on the individual will, but in the end how to choose, Ning Zetao heart should have a number.
On the surface, online social platforms have expanded the social circle and reduced people's sense of loneliness.
Network social sphere of influence is more and more extensive, not only gradually replace the traditional telephone contact, and even infiltrate into the real circle of life offline, quietly changing the current social life of the people.
The benefits of online networking are obvious, such as convenience and speed, making it particularly popular with younger groups.
According to a survey on college students' social habits, 57 percent of college students spend more than five hours a day using their mobile phones.
"Social networks have the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication, which meet the needs of contemporary college students."
Expanding relationships, talking more equally, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chatting more.
Newcomers to the company love to communicate with colleagues online, "because just into the unit we are not too familiar with, through social platforms like comments, the relationship is much closer than before."
Love to make friends is also commonly used online communication, "with friends before because of some misunderstanding did not contact for some time, and later in a large group of first dialogue a few words before they warm up again."
IT engineer Wu Yan is a deep network of social enthusiasts, most of his social life takes place online, network contacts several times more than the number of offline friends.
Wu Yan himself also admitted to being more "like a duck to water" on the Internet.
"You can reply to a friend when it's convenient for you, because you have a lot of time to think about words and you can express them more clearly."
"Hidden under the ID, you and I avoid face-to-face collision, not only have room to maneuver, and even give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds."
"People of different identities have the right and efficiency to speak the same language, and real-life social concerns seem to be dispelling in cyberspace."
However, Wu Yan's friend Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan in life is a "pretty boring house man."
Xiao Peng and Wu Yan met in a large group because they were both active speakers and soon became familiar with each other.
Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan is different from the Internet, the language is boring, do not take the initiative to express their views, flip-flopping is a few words, "Oh, OK, yes", or "This I want to check online."

"It was so urgent," said Huang Yilin, who returned to her home in Mianyang, Sichuan province, in a telephone interview on August 11. "My only thought was to save people!"

After entering the water, Huang Yilin, who is 165 centimeters tall, found that she could not step on it in the end.
Before looks the calm surface of the water, but below is the torrent!
But she was still desperate to swim to the little girl.
Huang said the river was muddy and fast-flowing, less than five meters away, and it took almost all of her strength.
She pushed the little girl as hard as she could to the bank of the river. "The slope was so slippery that I was afraid I wouldn't have the strength to sink."
So, Huang asked her mother for help and heard her daughter's call for help. Ms. Yin, who was not good at water, prepared to go into the water to rescue her and was stopped by the tourists next to her.
August 10, Huang Yilin jumped into the river to save people after the news spread, Ms. Yin received a lot of friends and family condolences, praise, but also by many friends and family "accountability."

Ms. Yin said with fright that even though it was dangerous, she would still support her daughter's choice if she was in a scene like that again, and she was proud of her daughter!
Being forced, Huang rarely volunteered to go back into the water after learning to swim, "not expecting the skill to actually come in handy."
According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yilin, Huang Yilin is recognized as a "school bully" in the class, and is willing to help others.

The Wolong District People's Court of Nanyang City, Henan Province, heard that between September 30 and October 4, 2015, the defendant, Li Huiwang, used pseudo-base station equipment to send fraudulent messages in Tongbai County and Nanyang City.

Siberian tiger, currently listed as an endangered (EN) species on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.
Data from joint monitoring by China, the United States, Russia and other countries in 1998 showed that there were only four to six wild Siberian tigers and three to five northeastern leopards in Jilin Province, according to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province.
According to Yu Changchun, director of the protection division of the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, the population of Siberian tigers and northeastern leopards in China is growing significantly and the distribution area is expanding in recent years as Jilin Province has continuously increased its protection of wild animals.
The latest monitoring data for 2015 showed that 27 wild Siberian tigers and 42 northeastern leopards were detected in Jilin Province alone.
As the world's flagship wildlife conservation species distributed in the Sino-Russian border region, the cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance for the population restoration and reproduction of wild Siberian tigers and leopards.
Jilin Province has previously established a long-term and stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russia, according to the forestry department of Jilin Province.
At the 2016 China Hunchun Tiger and Leopard Conservation International Forum, which ended on November 11, the forestry departments and animal protection organizations of China and Russia once again reached a number of consensus.
Strengthening cooperation between China and Russia to protect tigers and leopards is not only a very urgent task facing the protection of tigers and leopards in China, but also an urgent task for maintaining the health of tiger and leopard populations in Russia, said the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department.
As a leading cadre of Party members, Sun Fujian lost his ideals and convictions, seriously violated the Party's discipline, and the Party's 18th National Congress is still not converging, failing to stop, defying the wind and discipline, the nature of which is bad and serious.
After this case, after a number of media reports, became the focus of the case, the social impact is very bad.
After the case, Haikou Municipal Public Security Bureau, the leadership of the criminal police detachment attaches great importance to, immediately organized a detachment of elite police force to take the initiative to launch an investigation.
The police immediately executed the online pursuit of the suspect, took a variety of measures to arrest, and through contact with the police in the field to find out the whereabouts of Wang Guo.
Due to the fact that the suspect is a habitual thief, has been repeatedly dealt with by the public security organs, has a strong anti-detection capabilities, coupled with his long-term drug abuse, drug addiction during interrogation often attack, interrogation work is very difficult.
Greenlandic sharks, also known as sleeping sharks, are widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland and reach an adult height of 4 to 5 metres.
But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about 1cm a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an extraordinarily long life.
Traditional dating methods typically use calcified tissue from animals, and some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calcified tissue is rare in Greenland sharks.
The new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, switched to radiocarbon dating using the eye lenses of Greenland sharks.
The method has previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed the largest shark had an estimated lifespan of 392 years, with a margin of error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach a maximum of 512 years old.
In addition, female Greenland sharks reportedly do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 4 metres in length, which translates to an age of at least 156 years.
As a result, the researchers wrote in their paper, the Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate known on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived champion right whale (211 years old).
Over the past year, the exchange rate reform has achieved remarkable results, and the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, at the same time laying the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
From the market performance point of view, over the past year, the two-way floating characteristics of the RMB exchange rate is obvious, the exchange rate flexibility increased, the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
Since the reform of the exchange rate, the RMB against the United States dollar more than 100 points up and down fluctuations frequently occur, but the process of rising and falling alternately.
The last change before the August 11, 2005, was a significant appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar over the past decade.
Since the implementation of the new exchange rate reform, the RMB has changed its previous appreciation, with the RMB exchange rate depreciating by about 8% in a year.
On October 1, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the renminbi as a SDR (Special Drawing Rights) weighted currency.
This week, statistics released by China's General Administration of Customs showed that China's imports and exports totaled 13.21 trillion yuan in the first seven months of this year, down 3 percent from the same period last year.
In July, however, the total value of China's exports and imports fell by only 0.9 per cent year-on-year, with exports in particular up 2.9 per cent year-on-year.
Experts believe that despite signs of stabilization in exports and imports in July, expectations should not be too high.
In July, the total value of China's imports and exports was 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9 percent year-on-year.
Of this total, 1.22 trillion yuan was exported, an increase of 2.9 percent; imports were 873 billion yuan, a decrease of 5.7 percent; and the trade surplus was 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34 percent.
Although the total value of imports and exports still fell year-on-year, the export figures showed an increase, marking the fifth consecutive monthly increase in exports since March this year.

In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will travel to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference, according to China Voice's Evening Peak.
The Conference on African Development, led by Japan, will also be the first to move to Africa, as all five previous meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan.
In this regard, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said that the meeting on the ground in Africa to help attract African and European countries to Japan's attention.
To coincide with Abe's trip, the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan will send parliamentary groups to relevant countries, according to Kyodo news agency.
It is no coincidence that the path of Japan ’ s “accession ” began in the early 1990s, and that the African Development Conference, initiated by Japan, also began in 1993!
With 53 seats in the United Nations, Africa is an important vote holder of the United Nations. How can Japan abandon Africa if it wants to become a permanent member of the United Nations?
It will also exchange views with relevant people in various countries on the extremist group Islamic State and the response to terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida recently stated his intention on the African Development Conference at the United Nations Security Council.
Abe announced here that he would provide 100 billion yen (6.1 billion yuan) in aid over five years for the sake of stability in sub-Saharan Africa.
Observers generally agree that Japan's generosity to Africa has always had two main purposes: to increase Japan's sense of presence in Africa; and to try to win the support of African countries on the issue of membership.
"Politically, Africa is relatively underdeveloped, but it has a large number of countries, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big vote field,'" said Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan.
Japan will not give up in the future, and its work on Africa will not stop there, and it will continue to strengthen.
On the economic front, because of Japan's relatively strong production capacity, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the current context of fewer children and an ageing population, domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later, Japan has repeatedly launched the "sprint" to become a permanent member, but it has failed to do so.
According to Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan, Japan's intention to join the WTO is clear at a glance, but the road to becoming a permanent member is bound to be difficult.
In order for Japan to achieve its goal, it must first establish good relations with its neighboring countries. Among them, Japan needs to have a correct attitude, whether on the issue of geopolitical rivalry or on the issue of ethnic disputes and historical understanding.

A couple from France spent nearly three hours at the event and had an experience in the mini floats mobile classroom.
"I found out about this special festival on the Internet, so I decided to come and see it and feel fresh."
They said that while there were similar festivals in France to honour their ancestors, the atmosphere was heavy, unlike here, where there was music, food and traditional crafts to learn.

Liu Cigui went to Sanya to investigate "Shuangxiu and Shuangcheng" and requested to upgrade the level of urban construction and management
On the morning of the 12th, Liu Cigui presided over a symposium and listened to a report on the progress of the pilot project of "Shuangxiu" and "Shuangcheng" in Sanya City and the opinions and suggestions of various departments concerned.
Liu Cigui fully affirmed the phased results achieved and the good experiences and good practices created in the pilot project.
Liu stressed that Sanya should firmly seize the opportunity of historical development, take the pilot project of "double repair" and "twin cities" as an important task, and give full play to the leading role of good demonstration in the province's economic and social development.
To improve the international level of international tourism island to play a good leading role, starting from the little details, enrich the international element, to create international quality.
We should play a good leading role in the integration of urban and rural areas and global tourism, speed up the construction of towns with distinctive customs, integrate tourism elements into each project, and build every village and town in Sanya into a tourist attraction.
It is necessary to play a good leading role in the "100-day action for social investment in services," promote the construction of a number of major projects and parks, ensure the landing of high-quality projects, and implement the requirements of the major action.
Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, Sanya Municipal Party Secretary Zhang Qi, Vice Governor Wang Lu, Secretary General of the provincial government Lu Zhiyuan to participate in the investigation and discussion.
During her 14-year career, Deng Yaping has won 18 world championships, becoming the first person in China's Olympic history to win four Olympic gold medals.
She has been ranked number one in the world for eight consecutive years and is the longest-serving female player in the history of table tennis to be ranked number one in the world.
On 26 September 2010, he was appointed deputy secretary-general of the People's Daily and general manager of the People's Search Network Co., Ltd., a director-level cadre.
A few days ago, she and Yu Minhong will join forces to create the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform.
In Chinese sports, there is also a group of star coaches who have won numerous honors for their country in their days as athletes, and who, after retiring from the sport, have passed on what they have learned over the years to those who have gone on to win the championship.
As China's first world champion in men's gymnastics, Huang chose to pick up the pointer after retiring.
From the coach of the women's team to the coach of the men's team and then to the head coach, Huang Yubin built an "Olympic gold team" and led the team to a mythical record of 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 bronze medals at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tian Liang has been constantly advertising endorsement, but also in recent years played a "Cowherd", "Lei Feng" and other important roles.
Many NBA players have proven themselves, but some progress and some decline.
Whether it's because of increased age or limited playing time, there are a number of players who have regressed each season.
Of course, some of the "regressions" may simply be data shrinkage, and the strength of these players may not have declined.
Even though Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, he probably won't do as well with the Bulls as the Heat.
He and Rondo have limited backcourt range and the reigning star Buttler has just 32.8 percent from three-point range, making their offense packed for next season.
Coming to Windy City, the Blitzkrieg is bound to cede more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a regimen to play in the regular season.
Okafor is in an awkward position, having to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball rights in the new season as the first choice for the 76ers last season.
The rivalry may not come soon, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA and Embiid will have to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but Okafor's place in the 76ers' lineup remains a question.
Okafor scored 32 percent from the low post offense last season, a higher percentage than Cousins, Vucevic and Brooke Lopez, while his usage rates were also high in the league's top 40.
With Simmons already showing excellent possession forward potential and Embiid with a body better suited to NBA games, Okafor's position is probably hard to be any more solid.
Thompson's usage has stabilized in the league's top 20 over the past two seasons, the best of his career.
The problem, though, is that Thompson's usage is bound to decline with Durant's arrival, and that's bound to affect his play.
The impact will be not only in terms of the number of shots taken, but the Towns' holding offense will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which in some ways will also make it easier for opponents to defend him.
Durant's arrival is sure to shrink the Warriors' player numbers, but it's probably Thompson who has shrunk the most.
But that doesn't mean Tom's level has regressed, it's more like he's made sacrifices for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better than the numbers reflected last season, not only because his basket efficiency came to a career high, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the GDP combination eventually came to an end, and as the youngest of the three, the French sports car didn't have much fuel in its tank.
After getting their third championship ring, only Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only one with more than James.
Oh, and by the way, James just brought Cleveland its first professional sports championship trophy in the last 52 years.
James, who arrived in the 14th season of his career, needs to be better guaranteed physical strength and ready for the playoffs.
As a result, James' numbers are likely to slide further during the regular season, and he'll share more of the burden with Irving, though he'll still be an easy top-three player in the league.
"We must carry forward the talent we have learned at home in Russia," he said.
Huang Jing, president of the Moscow Federation of Overseas Chinese, said excitedly when he saw a reporter from China News Network on the 12th, local time.
Not long ago, she attended a training course on Chinese Talents (Calligraphy, Painting) organized by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of China and hosted by Jinan University.
Just participated in the training course, their painting and calligraphy do not know where to start, the results at the end of the training course, has been able to draw and write their own works.
When he returns to Moscow, he must use the knowledge and skills he has learned to make his own contribution to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
Na Yanwei, secretary general of the Russian Association for the Promotion of Chinese Culture, who also attended the training course, also felt the same way.
She said she had made great progress with the help of her training class teacher, while also feeling the heavy responsibility of being an "overseas communicator of Chinese culture."
After returning to Russia, he said, he will spread and promote Chinese traditional culture among Chinese and Russians who love Chinese culture.
At 19: 35 today, in the first start of the 22nd round of the Chinese Super League in a game, Chongqing Lifan away to challenge Beijing Guoan.
In the 29th minute, Wang Dong opened the scoring with a penalty, and in the 39th minute, new signing Caldecott scored the first goal of the Chinese Super League with an assist from Fernando, and in the 81st minute, Guoan pulled one back.

A minute later Park Cheng in the left in front of the cross, in the middle of the box Dabao strafing did not kick the correct part of the force sails goalkeeper Deng Xiaoping to confiscate the ball.

Great Britain won silver in the sevens rugby match and Fiji won gold
The British failed to extend their previous excellent performance in front of Fiji in Thursday night's sevens rugby final, which was beaten 43-7 by Fiji at Rio Tiodoro Stadium.
Fiji won the gold medal with an impeccable performance in possession, steals, dodges, matchups, runs and power, the country's first ever Olympic medal.
The silver medal was also a small consolation to the defeated British team, which won its third silver medal of the day, a feat that was enough to make the British rugby team proud: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa all the way to their first rugby sevens tournament at the Olympics.
Earlier in the day, Britain edged South Africa 7-5, which may have affected their form in the final.
But in any case, the current Fijian team is good enough to beat a spirited 15-a-side team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will wear a gold medal, which may or may not be a consolation to the British team, namely Wimbledon's Fiji coach Ben Ryan, who was head coach of the British team.
It was not easy for the British team to get where they are today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's tutelage, they were undefeated at the Adelaide International Sevens Rugby Tournament.
And now, they're just one step away from the title.
Although they have been hit hard, they have also made amazing progress.
Fiji had the advantage in the opening minutes, leaving the British team without a fight.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like crashing into a string of moving buss.By the time Ossie Colliniseau slammed into the corner flag zone, the World Series champions were well ahead 5-0.
Just four minutes into the game, Jerry Toowey scored another touchdown on the right wing.
At 12-0, the British team barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's powerful tackle kept Giants' Lyon Nakalava from scoring for the third time, but only slowed Fiji's scoring.
Yassa Willemaru touched down in the right corner on seven minutes. 17-0, to add insult to injury for the British team.
That Carrawa scored another point, and the first half of the game... with one minute left.
Watmore LaVovo then broke through the English defence and went straight to the scoring line.
The score was already 29-0 at halftime.
It is as if the Fijians were born to play rugby for seven, while the English team are still in their infancy.
That's the way it is.
The British made a huge change in the second half and hit the Fijians' defence for the full four minutes, which was good in the first half, but then the Fijians played a brilliant match, with Joshua Tuesova scoring again.
Dan Norton created a scoring opportunity for the British team, touching down in the left corner and changing the score to 36-7, but the game was already in the hands of the South China Sea island nation, with their fans singing, waving flags and dancing loudly on the platform.
The excellent performance of the Fijian team was to be applauded.
Mata William stopped a nonchalant Fijian attack in the final minute.
The final whistle sounded and the Fijians hugged, while the defeated British team could only regret its exit.
Earlier in the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semifinals, while Great Britain edged South Africa in a fierce semi-final matchup.
Kyle Brown helped South Africa take the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored with a superb foot in the second half.
After that, England's Anthony's brother Marcus Watson secured the team's victory with a brilliant interception that ended with the British team winning the silver medal.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning were inspired by their cancer-stricken coach to win rowing gold
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most moving piece of gold medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning have trained in 220 punitive lifts since their first paddle, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa is of even greater significance.
Although they were the only two to paddle, the voice of one other person on board - coach Robin Williams - had been with them as they hit their second straight Olympic gold medal in the women's double sculls, the first British combination of rowing women to reach that height.
They have a 39-game unbeaten record and have an absolute advantage.
What we're seeing is these two talented athletes moving gracefully on the water, but that's not the whole story of this victory.
There are many volunteers behind every rowing gold medal, and it is their constant dedication that makes a difference, and none more so than a coach who learned 30 months ago that he had cancer and didn't know if he would live to see the day.
As he said, death could come at any moment.
I had bladder cancer and they operated on me.
Without surgery, cancer cells can spread throughout the body.
That way, the situation would be much worse.
This will change your opinion a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment in early 2014 to minimize the impact, although that might not be appropriate in the circumstances.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better soon.
It was an inspiration to me.
I was in the hospital and although they said a few steps would be enough, I still walked around the ward 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time.
That's where it all started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, and that makes the journey a little bit longer.
The first thing on their minds at the moment they won gold was Williams, who was slightly more talkative than usual this morning to overcome his anxiety.
"I'm in a bad mood this week, maybe a little extreme, but this gold medal is really something," said Steinen, a former captain of the Royal Artillery Corps, who will travel to Afghanistan.
It kept telling me how much it meant to me and how hard I, Helen and Robin worked.
It's a reward for three years of hard work by Helen, Robin and me.
Without Robin, we're still just nobody, thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have found a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning were unbeaten in five years.
The combination sets penalties that their rivals can't match.
Even in the final 500m, when New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Graf still had plenty of physical reserves.
It was really breathtaking at the time.
Helen called: "Keep the pace, keep the pace."
It's really important not to be influenced by your opponent.
We're off to a great start and we're not looking forward to doing anything earth-shattering.
We didn't think about the glory today, we just wanted to paddle every paddle and win this race, and we did.
It took the pair a year to decide their future.
Graff will marry TV adventurer Steve Bachchard next month.
Now, though, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
It would put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realise I was an Olympic champion.
It was a whole new experience and I felt very nervous.
About four minutes have now passed.
"I feel much better," she says.

Bulgaria sees inflation for first time in eight months
National statistics show that the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1 per cent in July.
It was the highest rate of inflation in several years (since June 2012) and broke above zero for the first time since October last year (0.2 per cent).
The average annual inflation rate (as measured by the consumer price index) over the past 12 months (August 2015-July 2016) was -0.8 per cent compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014-July 2015).
The consumer price index for July 2016 was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, representing a monthly inflation rate of 1.0 per cent.
The inflation rate so far this year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) is -0.2%, compared to July 2015, when the annual rate was -0.2%.
Prices of the following categories of consumer goods increased in July 2016 compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 per cent), transport (1.8 per cent), entertainment and culture (6.3 per cent), restaurants and hotels (1.2 per cent) and other goods and services (0.3 per cent).
Declining prices were recorded for clothing and footwear (2.2 per cent), furniture, appliances and routine maintenance (0.5 per cent) and medical care (0.1 per cent).
At the same price as last month were alcoholic drinks and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications, education.
Snapchat's' anime 'effect accused of satirizing Asians
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers believe it has a racial tinge.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality and make people look ridiculous with its filter tool.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivating, bending features, producing more than 30 million retouched selfies every day.
Any mistakes will be noticed by the public immediately.
Snapchat lenses have been criticised, with the app accused of encouraging the portrayal of blacks or the beauty of white skin.
So when the app this week offered some users a filter that could create squint, grotesque teeth and pink face effects, some critics called it a racial satire on Asia's "yellow race."
They even wonder whether these recurring problems mean the company has bigger problems with diversity.
Wednesday's report by The Verge and Motherboard sparked outrage after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company's explanation: The filter is a tribute to the anime character, not a satire of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the damaging stereotypes of reality.
Others are also adamantly opposed to these anime images.
A Korean-American art student who tweeted about the photos and shared them widely said in an email that the filters were "at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable."
"It's hard to tell the difference between an extremely disgusting Asian satirical image and the effect of a filter," she added.
While it's not just the yellow in the filter, the yellow is extremely devalued.
Snapchat is not alone in reaching the bottom line of these cultures.
From corporate boards to Hollywood and the devices we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat's large group of young people can be sensitive because they are more ethnically diverse than older generations.
When one of Snapchat's filters produced an insulting image for users, Zhu Katie, 25, said in an interview on Thursday: "It's harder than ever to escape the spotlight."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she believed the racial controversy reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the hiring process.
Ms. Chu criticized the company's mostly white employees, its all-male leadership, and added a tag at the end of the article: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have people of all colors on their staff to make that decision, or they have people of color on their staff, but their position doesn't allow them to speak out," says Ms. Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company does not release data on employee diversity and says it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic background of its employees, but a spokeswoman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on people with low internal ratios and promote inclusion.
Ms Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us who are against this."
Congressional panel says military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel noted that officials at U.S. Central Command changed intelligence reports to describe the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria as more optimistic than it actually was.
The interim report, from a task force of Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, said there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts who said their superiors were falsifying their assessments of the US war with the Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news release on the report, "Intelligence vetted by senior leadership at Central Command presents a more optimistic picture of U.S. counterterrorism operations than is actually the case, and consistently more optimistic analysis than other intelligence agencies."
"The actions of Central Command are unacceptable, with our fighters suffering from war on one side and senior policymakers receiving the wrong analysis," said the California Republican delegate.
The question of the leadership of the Central Command has extended to the highest levels of the institution.
The report details long-standing problems at Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing U.S. training of Iraqi forces.
While there is no conclusive evidence that top Obama administration officials ordered changes to the reports, according to the report's description, the analysts felt pressured by leaders from Central Command to be more optimistic about the threat from Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than they actually were," the report said.
For example, a Central Command official has said publicly that a major military operation to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under IS control.
"The results have been clear after months of investigation," Mike Pompeo, a Republican delegate from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the top intelligence officials at U.S. Central Command manipulated the command's intelligence products, hiding the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republican Party set up a task force after learning from analysts that intelligence about ISIS was being manipulated.
More findings will follow this report, released on Thursday, as the investigation continues.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation into Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraqi peacekeeping forces," Xie Anda, a representative of the committee's Democratic leadership, said in a statement.
Mr Sheanda said the process "interfered with the release of intelligence", demoralised analysts and "could not accept different opinions."
But Mr. Sheanda and Democrats also said they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on analysts at Central Command so that their conclusions were consistent with "preconceived or political narratives."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported by The Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Attorney General opened an investigation after receiving complaints from analysts at Central Command.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Major Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report until the attorney general's investigation is complete.
But he said: "Experts sometimes disagree over the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes."
The impact of the investigation has outweighed the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has succeeded, as more and more Defense Department officials claim.
But last year, the claims raised public questions about the extent to which President Obama could trust the assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas issued by Central Command.
The criticism of ISIS intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy more than a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper noting that George Bush's administration insisted on sending small forces to Iraq despite the opposition of many analysts and with little regard for the post-invasion situation in 2003.
Mr. Hooker played a key role in the campaign against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hooker's team came to the conclusion that airstrikes targeting Islamic State refineries had not significantly cut the economic revenue of the terrorist group, which has built temporary refineries to continue selling oil on the black market, a far cry from the published statement.
Central Command did not release the findings to the public, according to a September report in Time magazine.
Central Command commander Lloyd Austin III came under fire last year after lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is being replaced by Joseph Votel at Central Command.
US wins four in a row in women's hockey to go head-to-head with UK
Katie Bam, who scored three points in the 6-1 win over Japan, led the U.S. women's hockey team in a 3-0 victory over India on Thursday.
Five goals in two games was a feat, but Bam, 27, said she didn't know she was doing so well.
"I don't know anything about it," she says.
I'm not the type of person who remembers how many goals I've scored.
All she knows is that the United States has won four straight games and will be competing for first place in the group with the undefeated British team that beat Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States face off in the final match of Saturday's first round.
Both teams advanced to the quarter-finals, a game that will determine who comes out top of the group.
The team that finished first in the group will be able to go further by avoiding the mighty Dutch, who came out first in the other group.
The United States performed miraculously on Saturday, finishing at the bottom of 12 teams at the London Games four years ago.
Bam was also on that team at the time.
Bam, who grew up in Breuber, Pa., first picked up a hockey stick at the age of three (her twin sister played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team at 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to make the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were viewed unfavorably.
The following year, Englishman Craig Panam was head coach and everything began to change.
"It's a change of culture, mentality and substance," Mr Bam said.
We weren't at our current level in London at the time.
We had a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam came first with a close-range backhand shot in the first half.
India's were unbeaten in the tournament, but the team showed amazing tenacity and held on to a 1-0 run towards the end of the third quarter when Bam erupted.
She took the ball on a long run down the left side of the court, then cut inside to the middle and volleyed into the net, giving the United States a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The United States vs. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs is zero for the first time in the tournament, scoring one goal each in his first three victories.
This time she is out of the ordinary.
Bam, too.
"We're in good shape," Mr Parnham said, but just how good will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Cheesy food from the Great Depression.
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat down to lunch in the president's office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt enjoyed Fifth Avenue delicacies such as foie gras and Maryland stewed fish.
That day, his menu was simple: ketchup devil's eggs, mashed potatoes and preserved fruit pudding for dessert.
"It's about sharing food with people who are suffering," said Jane Siegman.
"It also reflects the way Americans eat," added her husband, Andrew Coe.
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are both food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, Chowder, was about Chinese food in the United States, and Ms. Sigman's book, "Orchard 97," tells the story of slum dwellers through food.
Their new book, "A Big Dinner," about the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression, will be published Tuesday by Harper's Press.
After showing some common food insights, they met a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch counter in the ironing district that has been open since the economic crash of 1929.
Ms. Siegman, 54, ordered a cream cheese with a chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, ordered a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable platter.
The reporter ordered a meatloaf, which the couple thought was appropriate to discuss the Great Depression diet.
"Bread was very popular at the time," Ms. Sigman said.
There was peanut bread, liver bread, soybean bread.
They are made from a single ingredient and a cheap topping that can be poured over the ingredients.
Imagine your dinner is full of peanuts.
Mr. Coe made a strange appearance.
"They must be like lead in your stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans ate buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked meals for the male farm workers, with freshly baked pies for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans. "The Feast" documents how the country suddenly ceased to be a land of plenty.
Mr. Coe explains why he and his wife wrote the book: "At the time, food had become a major source of irritation for Americans."
Another unpleasant topic is the shabby new food: "Enchanted foods" such as bread and stews have become the main course, and stews are "the best way to cook leftovers," Ms. Siegman said, because chefs can use the butter in sauces to mask the unpalatable ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which has dominated the American dinner table for years, has become a rare luxury.
Strange hodgepodge is all about calories, and nutrition comes first, rather than taste or even basic culinary knowledge.
In the course of researching the book, including various recipes, Ms. Zigman made a roasted onion stuffed with peanut oil.
"It's not common at the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Ms Zigman said: "It's also so bizarre."
Peanut oil doesn't go well with grilled onions.
This is a feature of many family meals.
Family economists influence the nation's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as head chef at the Federal Bureau of Family Economics from 1923 to 1943, which is unprecedented in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be "frugal" and brave enough to turn bad food such as creamy pasta with carrots into good food.
"The Great Dinner" is a sumptuous "historical treasure."
Particularly interesting is the government's response to the hungry, such as President Citizen Herbert Hoover's "I can't handle other people's business" attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse of his childhood, his diet was as refined as a millionaire's.
Mr Coe said: "He likes to eat European Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He wore an evening dress and dined in a gilded dining room.
He was clearly separated from the people.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had it not been for his wife, Eleanor, who encouraged him to set an example in his diet.
As the book says, the housekeeper Ms. Roosevelt hired had no interest in taste, so "the food in the White House was not only the worst food in Washington, but the worst cooked."
As soon as America got back to business, many of the recipes of the Great Depression were abandoned.
What's left, says Ms Zigman, is our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they learned more about Ms. Siegman's mother's eating habits, such as how she doesn't throw food away.
"She was very afraid of wasting food," Mr. Coe said.
"She actually made a lot of people sick," Ms. Sigman recalled.
For example, there has been a "cream puff" incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the fruity pudding that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called crème brulee," Ms. Sigman said, adding that a trendy name for an ordinary dish is "the usual trick."
There is no whipped cream in this dessert, only preserved fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone grudgingly dipped the spoon into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, this dessert is not bad.
Mr. Ko took a second and a third spoonful.
Feeling that it was an acceptable and affordable dessert, he told his wife, "It would be more delicious with chopped walnuts."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report showed crude oil production continued to increase in July, with Saudi production hitting a new high.
The report does not prevent markets from casting doubt on OPEC's credibility, and the road to recovery in oil prices is likely to remain thorny.
On Monday, Saada, OPEC's rotating president and Qatar's energy minister, said the group would hold an informal meeting on the sidelines of the international energy forum on September 26-28.
Production across the OPEC group, including Gabon, rose 46,000 bpd to 33.11 million bpd in July, according to the monthly report released Wednesday.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined products, adding to the extent of oversupply in the market.
International oil prices closed lower for the second day in a row on the news, along with higher crude oil production expectations in the United States and an unexpected increase in crude oil inventories.
Up to Wednesday's close, light crude for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was down 2.48 per cent and London Brent for October delivery was down 2.07 per cent.
Reuters believes the proposed meeting of oil-producing nations is unlikely to lead to a significant tightening of supply, and data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration has weighed on sentiment.
Iran produced up to 3.85 million barrels of crude oil a day, the highest level since 2008, official news agency Fars said Wednesday, citing a statement from Iran's oil minister, Zangane.
As soon as news of the meeting emerged, Russian Energy Minister Novak said there was no need for a new round of frozen production talks under the current oil price.
The last meeting of oil producers was in April, and OPEC members failed to agree on any measures.
Emma Richards, oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, said markets and the media may have overreacted to the OPEC meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC changed sentiment by sending signals that they would broker a deal.
The trick is like smoke and mirrors that distract the eye (deliberately giving the wrong impression).
According to Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank, the chances of OPEC trying to stabilise markets through the September meeting are thought to be low.
This is likely to further undermine market confidence in OPEC, after all, the group has staged a "wolf in the door."
All localities should focus on medical institutions that publish medical advertisements in violation of regulations, have concentrated on reporting complaints and have been punished many times in the past.
The National Health and Family Planning Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will, in due course, organize special supervision and inspection work in some provinces.
According to media reports, due to the previous large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, resulting in the current serious problem of product homogenization, the investment boom gradually receded, capital into the wait and see period.
According to the Hong Kong Hospital Management Research Center Elliptic data show that within a year of starting up a large number of Internet health care companies died, about 20% of the start-up Internet health care companies no longer exist.
However, just as most internet healthcare companies struggle to finance rounds A or B, several segment leaders are still gaining traction.
It seems that Internet medical entrepreneurship can never be a "swarm", but to look at the market demand, sink down to do special, do deep.
Yuyue made a capital contribution of 12 million yuan, accounting for 40 percent of the registered capital, and Kyushu Tong Instrument Company made a capital contribution of 18 million yuan, accounting for 60 percent of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the country's policy support in medical information, electronic, integrated supply chain management system gradually into all levels of hospitals.
The cooperation between Yuyue and Kyushu Tong is precisely aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management system, and using this as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many internet healthcare companies, iBaby has been focused on the internet obstetrics vertical since its inception, working both as a mother and a doctor.
Pregnant mothers are not only entitled to free 24-hour and one-on-one consultation with a doctor in charge, but are also entitled to paid, directed medical consultation.
At the doctor's end, iBaby breaks geographical boundaries by organizing experts to give microlectures, such as online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges and case discussions, to doctors at the grass-roots level.
There are currently three sections on the doctor's side, one for continuing education for doctors, one for doctor socialising and the other for doctors seeking help.
It provides services such as online learning, case discussion, academic exchanges, social platforms with hospitals and doctors in the same departments, legal assistance needed in doctor-patient relationship or personal life, and entrepreneurship support.
CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali Health was "willing to sink in" to take down health big data, according to media reports.
Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism, in the same entry on the writing methods are not consistent.
Ali's current layout in the field of health care is divided into three sections, namely Ali Health, Tmall Medicine Hall and Alipay Future Hospital.
"It's not just a matter of how much money you have," Wang admits. "It's a matter of getting down to it and being able to bear the loneliness and do it slowly."
Staying up late to watch the Olympic Games is easy to damage the heart
Brazil's Olympic events are in full swing, and many citizens will stay up to watch them even if they are broadcast in the middle of the night in the country.
In response, doctors specifically warned that staying up late to watch the tournament had health risks that could trigger cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up for a long time, the hormone will still be secreted in large quantities, the human experience continues to be in a state of tension and excitement, can not get a normal recovery, easy to cause vasoconstriction, blood pressure rise, resulting in cardiovascular disease.
Han specifically cautioned that groups with cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits and family history were more likely to develop cardiovascular disease if they stayed up late.
Staying up late for a long time not only affects cardiovascular function, but also gastrointestinal function, the immune system, the neuroendocrine system, and even the risk of developing tumors.
For older friends, Han suggests trying not to stay up late to watch the Olympics, especially for groups with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup, Han Zhiyuan had seen a patient in his 60s whose heart attack was triggered or related to staying up late to watch the game.
Han Zhiyuan said that so far this year, its departments have received some 25-year-old patients with myocardial infarction or stroke, which is largely a result of the patient's long stay up late lifestyle.
1. Don't stay up late every day, and occasionally stay up late to watch your favorite sports. Other sports might as well wait for the next day to see a replay of the event.
2. Stay up late when the timely supplement of water, eat more fruit, can prevent blood vessel blockage, enhance the body's immunity.

The documentary Polar is a large work focusing on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the third pole of the earth. It tells the story of the integration of Tibetan tradition and modernity and the interaction between Tibet and the world from a new perspective.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, which almost led to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The event was seen as the culmination of the Cold War, known as the "Cuban Missile Crisis."
Little is known, however, that a strong solar storm, also during the Cold War, nearly led the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, an event that was not first made public by researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a powerful solar storm caused intense interference with the U.S. military's radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
The radars are part of a U.S. ballistic missile early warning system used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time and looked at unclassified literature.
In the 1960s, to prevent a sudden nuclear war by the Soviet Union, the US Air Force always had a portion of warplanes carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky, the paper wrote.
Unaware that the solar storm, not the Soviet Union, was to blame for the jamming, the American military commander ordered the fighters to be put into combat readiness.
Fortunately, the US military's research into solar activity and its electromagnetic interference with the Earth, which began in the late 1950s, eventually stopped this potential military conflict.
Later, he compiled the information provided by the Air Weather Service of the United States Air Force and submitted a detailed report.
As a direct consequence of the solar storm, the United States military has since viewed space weather as a combat concern and established a more robust space weather forecast system.
Members of the public who find their cars obstructed by unfamiliar vehicles during their daily journeys can use the "Twitter Move Car" feature to address this obsession when the driver of the unknown vehicle cannot be reached.
August 11, Xi'an traffic police WeChat service number "Xi'an traffic police" launched "WeChat mobile" service.
With the launch of the service, everyday members of the public can solve such problems by using the "WeChat Move" feature when a strange vehicle obstructs their vehicle while the driver is away from the scene.
First, this new service function is fast and saves administrative costs; second, it respects and protects the personal privacy of citizens; and third, it is all-weather and all-time service.
As long as citizens have WeChat, they can be very convenient to operate on their own, which can relatively make both sides of the car can be relatively friendly and easy to "meet" to ease parking problems, and can reduce the occurrence of vehicle-related security cases.
On the other hand, for those who refuse to drive, illegally park or obstruct the passage of vehicles, Xi'an traffic control department said that the traffic police will then take different measures according to the actual situation, depending on the circumstances of the case to be dealt with.

The mixed doubles match, which took place on that day, also decided the top eight, although the drop of the top-seeded Mahu / Garcia combination, and the withdrawal of the Natto combination, made the mixed doubles race slightly less colourful.
On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly released a new edition of the U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines in New York, allowing Japan's armed forces to play a more offensive role around the world.
US Defense Secretary Ash Carter, US Secretary of State John Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japanese Defense Minister Nakatani attended a press conference in New York on the same day.
This is the fifth time that a Chinese nongovernmental think tank has published an assessment of Japan's military strength, and the fourth time it has launched an English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including general policy adjustment, military strength, national defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, structural reform, military training and exercises, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
According to the report, 2015 marked the end of a period in which the Abe administration pushed through several years of major policy adjustments in the security sector.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the area of security will be mainly at the operational level of the application of the rule of law, the implementation of strategies and the implementation of policies, rather than major adjustments and changes in frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report stressed that Abe ’ s cabinet is trying to achieve the multiple goals of promoting Japan ’ s “normal nationalization, ” stepping out of the Self-Defense Forces to intervene in international security affairs, strengthening the Japan-US alliance, and preventing China from dominating China through these three breakthroughs.
Previously, the China Society for Strategic Cultural Promotion issued assessments of Japan's military strength on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014 and June 30, 2015.
The Financial Times published an atlas of the residence of the US ambassador to China on August 12.
In contrast, the U.S. ambassador's residence, by its appearance, could well serve as a safe house in the next film adapted from John Le Carré's Cold War spy novel, the article said.
The residence is grey and heavily guarded by perimeter fences, a second inner wall, barbed wire and vehicle barriers.
Buying up short boards in public sports facilities
Black coal yard warehouse, into the "green grass" of the football field; red brick steeple plant, into a modern sports hall.
On National Fitness Day, Hangzhou Wangjiang outside the South Fallen Horse Camp Sports and Cultural Park, unveiled the mystery.
It used to be a coal mine and has been idle since it was closed more than a decade ago, leaving behind a large amount of illegal construction and domestic waste.
After renovation, it has become a sports and cultural park and will officially open to the public in November, providing free sports venues to the public and undoubtedly opening up a whole new fertile ground for national sports.
This is reminiscent of the Hangzhou Chen Jinglun Sports School, the Chinese swimming world's "Whampoa Military Academy" swim out of a number of world champions.
Swimming stars are constantly emerging, vividly illustrating the relationship between competitive sports and national sports - the rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional athletes.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of the national sports. Competitive sports depend on the national sports in a certain sense, and the national sports depend on the site conditions.
It is reported that as of 2015, China's per capita sports ground area, although it has been 150 times that of the founding of New China, still lags far behind the sports powerhouse.
In June this year, the State Council issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), with the development of mass sports as a key element.
In order to make up for this shortcoming, on the one hand, the relevant departments should give full consideration to the layout of stadiums and stadiums in their urban planning.
On the other hand, completed public sports venues, including those in schools and other units, should be opened as far as possible to enhance the efficiency of use.
The Rio Olympics, which are now in full swing, have inspired enthusiasm for sport and awakened a sense of participation.
Gilead receives legal fees in hepatitis C patent battle with Merck
According to the U.S. District Judge's decision, Gilead Scientific is entitled to legal fees incurred in the hepatitis C patent lawsuit against the pharmaceutical company Merck Group of America.
In June, after a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of wrongdoing, including perjury and other unethical behavior, Gilead was exempt from paying $200 million in damages for Gilliard's best-selling drugs, Sofibwe and Havoni, for violating two of Merck's patents.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Lamberson Freeman said Gilliard did not have to bear the costs incurred by his defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, who dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of people with the disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilliard and Merck sued each other, each claiming to be the owner of Sofibuvir's laboratory work, the active ingredient in Gilliard's drugs.
U.S.-backed forces announce they have recaptured Manbij from ISIS
All remaining ISIS soldiers in the city have left and U.S.-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, a force spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after the departure of militants holed up inside the city.
Sharon Darwish of the Alliance of Syrian Democratic Forces (ADF) military council in Manbij told Reuters it had rescued more than 2,000 civilians who had been abducted by militants.
"Manbij is all under our control now, but we're still in the middle of a sweep," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent in federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2105 tax returns Friday showing the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent in federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speaking fees reached nearly $5.3 million, while the former secretary of state earned $3 million from publishers Simon & Schuster for a book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holden, released their 10-year tax returns.
The pair paid 20.3 percent of federal tax in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will continue to be the benchmark for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump covered up on false grounds and retracted his previous promise to release his tax returns.
Although not required by law, it is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public.
As a New York businessman, Trump, along with his lawyers, cited an IRS audit as a reason for refusing to release his tax returns.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Samms tweeted that it's up to you and attached a link to the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audit is complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump's refusal to release his tax returns would raise questions about his net worth, charitable donations, business dealings and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue to lash out, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his tax returns.
She raised the issue Thursday during an economic policy speech in Michigan.
"For decades, he refused to release his tax returns like other presidential candidates," she told the crowd.
According to Politico News, Trump paid hardly a penny in taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said that might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a big issue in the presidential race.
Clinton named a rule after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that guarantees people earning more than $1 million a year to pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway is based, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange his tax returns.
Mr Buffett said he was also being audited by the IRS and that Mr Trump was "afraid" not of tax authorities but of voters.
The earliest tax returns released by the Clinton campaign were in 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in Chabac, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they earned just $100 in wages.
Their main investments are low-cost index mutual funds, and the Clintons have a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticise Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code as Arab customers' demands' - Reuters News
A French filmmaker with Jewish roots revealed to the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli phone code, and that the hotel staff said it was in accordance with the "requirements" of Arab customers, sparking a public outcry.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Holocaust, expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in Frankfurt, Germany.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can call directly from their rooms.
Israel actually disappeared in Berlin, the capital of Germany, in 2016?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel through the Kempinski Hotel's call center.
Seeking an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Mr Lanzman said he was "shocked" by the answers he received at the front desk.
Hotel staff said it was a "deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
And the reason for doing so made the filmmaker even angrier.
Langzman quoted the employee as saying: "Most of our guests are Arabs and they are demanding that the Israeli code be removed."
According to the South German Daily News, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Haddas Handelsmann, called the incident a "great humiliation."
We were surprised to learn of the incident.
The incident itself is a huge disgrace.
And happened in Germany and that hotel chain is even more humiliating.
This matter needs no explanation.
"We hope the hotel will come to the right conclusion," the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some see the Kempinski hotel as simply "kowtowing" to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed to the hotel as "shameless" and pointed out that the main street on the famous Kudam Street was near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel was quick to clarify all the allegations, claiming that everything was "negligent" and offering "apologies" to Lanzmann.
The Nande Daily News quoted Kempinski's representative as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the speed dial list."
The newspaper also said the Israeli code had been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to evict Brazilian students protesting
Students clashed with police during a protest against reforms to the government's public education system in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evict protesters.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas as law enforcement officials tried to disperse the students.
Several hundred students took part in the march to express their dissatisfaction with the proposals.
In an effort to save money, the governor of São Paulo state, Okmin, plans to close 100 public schools, and 300,000 students will switch schools.
Some students at the protest expressed their displeasure with interim President Michel Temer through graffiti on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who has been impeached by the state Senate.
Scottish cyclist Calm Skinner returns with fame after winning cycling gold
Scottish cyclist Calm Skinner helped the British trio successfully defend their Olympic gold medal following the 2012 London Olympics last night in the men's team race at the Rio cycling arena.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his fellow Scot, Sir Chris Hoy, as the centrepiece of the team, and even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when the young Skinner beat title favourite New Zealand and returned with the accolade.
Four years ago, the British team made a splash, while Hoy won the fifth of his six individual Olympic gold medals.
Hoey retired after finishing sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March.
The problem for the British team between the Beijing and London Games was to replace "first lap expert" Jamie Staff.
The team did just that when Sinders showed up.
Hoy's retirement also left a void that Chin Emadi and Matt Clapton both wanted to fill.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaching staff insisted that he be selected for the national team, and Skinner eventually lived up to expectations.
Skinner's partner, Hindes and Kenny, who won gold with Hoy four years ago, set an Olympic record in qualifying but was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the three British cyclists ended up beating their rivals to win gold.
While Sinders trailed slightly, Kenny took the lead for the team and Skinner held that lead to the end.
A change in strategy was key to the turnaround, with Sinders opting for a larger flywheel and therefore slower, and that allowed Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep up the pace.
Hoey watched as a BBC commentator, and Skinner, Kenny and Hinders saw him on the podium.
"It flattered me," said Mr Skinner, a 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist.
I'm just doing everything I can to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
This is unbelievable.
Nothing could be better than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Sinders admitted falling deliberately onto the track after a poor start.
He later withdrew the comment, while the British team's rivals were unable to appeal.
And there were no such problems with this victory.
"It's like being in London with the British flag all over the platform," Mr Sinders said.
We just formed a team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world titles, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic title.
It's just one race, one gold medal for the British team that won seven of the 10 track cycling gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics.
If this symbolises the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to be successful at the cycling pavilion for the next five days.
Based on the form Kenny has shown, it's not impossible for him to recreate Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals at one Olympics.
If so, Kenny, who is 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on March 23, which seems to be a sacred day for British sport, when Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born, will have six gold medals and a silver medal.
The result was the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next play in the three-day race, which begins today.
"I'm going to focus on this game for the time being," said the 28-year-old Bolton man.
Team games are always the best.
You can win games with your teammates.
Frankly, it's a bit lonely for one person to win.
"If he can win the other two gold medals, then he should be given a knighthood," Mr Sinders said.
It was the only game of the day that produced a medal, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doyle advanced to the four-kilometre team pursuit with the fastest time.
Their score was 351.943.
The world record for a gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympics is 351.659.
With the first round and final (10.42pm) taking place on Matchday Two today, Wiggins will no doubt be in the limelight.
He had an argument with match officials before qualifying yesterday when they asked him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rotherill Shander, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Millgate advanced to a new world record of 413.260 in the women's division, which ends tomorrow.
The British team relied on a strong team of track cyclists to take the lead in the middle of the Olympics and win multiple medals.
After showing its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cycling team has left everyone slightly disappointed on their way to Rio.
There were many ups and downs during the period, including the resignation of April technical director Sean Sutton over allegations of sexism and bullying and the retirement of legends such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But Cycling's first race night is proof enough that the British team will once again be playing the legend of reaching the top of the moment.

Amy is a smart and beautiful girl.
She is outgoing and lively, gets along well with her friends, and adapts well to the environment.
But Amy had a little secret in her heart: she couldn't focus on the learning, working tasks she had to do for a long time.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time. Usually the problem is not serious.
Even through scattered, modular time to study and work, she can basically complete the task, and achieved good results.
But when the task was heavy and time was tight, Amy felt very miserable and tormented.
The purpose of individual resistance to self-exposure and emotional experience is not to endanger the individual's self-knowledge and self-esteem.
Some behaviorist psychologists have interpreted impedance as an individual's disobedience to his or her behavior modification.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to calm herself down and feel the pain by relaxing her breathing.
And once she left that trapped situation, she felt relaxed and free again.
Rangers Han, 63, had a drunken argument with another tramp Xiao and stabbed him to death with a knife.

Uber's entry into the Taiwan market for four years has had a big impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
Taiwan's United Daily News reported on August 12 that more than 100 taxis took a detour around Taiwan's "Executive Yuan" in protest, causing severe traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
Cheng Li-chia, chairman of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, says drivers can no longer wait for Uber, which has been in Taiwan for four years, to meet only at the end of this month.
Yet the government has failed to live up to its word, dragging its feet.
Law-abiding taxi drivers, who belong to the bottom workers, feel cheated by the authorities by having to compete with the lawless but unrestricted Uber.
Originally titled: 2000 chickens from a farm in Jiangsu were seized by the court and sold without permission
After the judgment came into effect, because Li did not automatically fulfill the obligations determined in the judgment, Wang applied to Shuyang court for enforcement.
On 16 October 2014, the Shuyang Court issued a civil ruling ordering the seizure of 2,000 laying hens from all of Li's farms and that they should not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the seizure ruling, Li privately sold some of the hens seized in the farm without the permission of the Shuyang court.
By March 8, 2015, when the Shuyang County Public Security Bureau survey, only 142 laying hens were left in the farm.

The head of the industry coordination department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out here today that steel overcapacity is a global problem.
China's capacity utilization rate in recent years are higher than the global average, but also higher than the United States and Europe and other countries and regions.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The person in charge pointed out that the party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the global problem of steel overcapacity.
All departments and regions have actively implemented the State Council's plan and worked hard to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tons this year.
Proceeding from China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it has also taken a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The official stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially a market behavior, is derived from the demand of importing countries, consumers take into account the value for money and other factors after the independent choice.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not help to fundamentally solve the development problem of the global steel industry, on the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
When talking about debt, the person in charge stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Due to the large scale and wide range of assets of steel enterprises, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and it is possible to trigger regional risks if not handled properly.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the downward pressure on the economy has increased, social aggregate demand has gradually weakened, the utilization rate of capacity in some industries has declined, and difficulties in production and operation of enterprises have increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to changes in the market environment, production and operation is difficult to sustain or even close down, but subject to a number of institutional factors, in a market-oriented way to exit the obstacles more, become "zombie enterprises."
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases social management costs and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main reasons for the losses are the same as the difficulties faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law approach. The government is mainly to do a good job in the work of the staff and workers and social stability, to ensure a fair and just market order.
The official stressed that, in the next step, it is necessary to unswervingly continue to do a good job in capacity work to ensure the completion of five years to dissolve crude steel production capacity of 100 million to 150 million tons of the target task.
On the afternoon of October 10, when the Chinese tourist police made an appearance in Moscow's Red Square, they immediately attracted attention. Chinese tourists waved with surprise. Locals and foreign tourists couldn't help but stop and look back.

When encountering Spanish tourists coming to consult, the Moscow tourist police gave each other a patient explanation in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Bing.
"The fact that everyone in the Moscow tourist police knows a foreign language and some have more than two is very touching to us," he said.
"As an international tourism island, Hainan is gradually paying attention to attracting international tourists. We hope to improve our ability to match the status of international tourism island."
On the same day, before studying with the post, the Chinese tourist police also went to the Moscow city tourist police brigade station to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists and am very happy to see them travel to Russia."
"The questions they usually ask for help are: how to get there, where a monument is, how to get a taxi, how to get back to the hotel."
Moscow's urban environment and tourist atmosphere have become more and more attractive to foreign tourists in recent years, said Rysakov, head of Moscow's tourist police brigade.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, a tourism police force was set up in July 2014 to patrol and defend major attractions and help and channel tourists.
All Moscow tourist police officers are now fluent in English, with some also mastering Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups, based on their foreign language level, and attended classes twice a week to learn self-defense techniques, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"There are two tourist police officers who are starting to learn Chinese and are already speaking it well, and we're going to continue to improve their Chinese," Rysakov said.
Rysakov told reporters that since its establishment, the Moscow Tourism Police has accumulated some experience, hoping to inspire their counterparts in Sanya.
He believes that cooperation between the police departments of Russia and China will enhance the sense of security for their citizens to travel to each other's countries.
"The recruitment of personnel, policing model, equipment of Moscow tourism police, and good interaction with tourists have given us a lot of inspiration," Chen said.
At least nine provinces and cities, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, have issued detailed rules for the implementation of residence permits.
With regard to the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas generally propose that they need to live for more than six months and meet one of the conditions for having legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence and continuous schooling.
In terms of the treatment offered by residence permits, the "gold content" varies from place to place, and the range of public services and facilities offered in some areas has expanded compared with the state version of the rules.
These areas have increased the convenience for children to participate in the local entrance examination under the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing and other places have also explicitly requested that the scope of the provision of public services and facilities be gradually expanded and made known to the public on a regular basis.
For example, Fujian proposed that the scope of public services and facilities enjoyed by holders of residence permits should be made known to the public at least once every three years.
The Provisional Regulations on Residence Permit stipulate that if the conditions for residence permit application are met, the public security organ shall, within 15 days from the date of acceptance, make and issue a residence permit.
With regard to the time frame for issuance, most regions agree with the national version, which is issued within 15 days.
Hebei has made it clear that for those who meet the requirements for application and have complete materials, the police station of their place of residence shall issue their residence permits within three working days from the date of acceptance.
Jiangxi stipulates that if the conditions for applying for a residence permit are met and the supporting documents are complete, the public security organ shall make and issue a residence permit within five working days from the date of acceptance.
In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Residence Permits, the above-mentioned areas have all made it clear that applying for a residence permit for the first time will be exempted from the payment of the cost of the documentation.
For example, Sichuan requires that local police stations or commissioned community service agencies strictly implement the approved charging items and rates, and resolutely prohibit overcharging, overcharging or hitchhiking charges.
After investigation, on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, former secretary of the Dingnan County CPC Committee of Ganzhou City, reported to the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission to work as director of the party style and government style supervision room (deputy director level, one year's probation period).
The red wine consumed that night was provided by Li Youcai personally, and other expenses were borne by Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission reported that Chen Yangxia and Cheng Ziliang, among others, had violated the spirit of the eight central regulations and violated party discipline by organizing and accepting invitations to eat in private clubs.
Borgba had two yellow cards in the Coppa Italia last season and will be automatically banned for one match under the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA has extended his cumulative ban to the Premier League.
As a result, Borgba will be sidelined against Bournemouth on 14 August and his return to United will be postponed until his home game against Southampton on 20 August.
A rookie in the first round of 12 in 2014, Saric will officially land in the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
Saric is a young European player and many fans don't know him very well, but through this Olympics, it is believed that Saric's performance has left a deep impression.
The last time Croatia narrowly beat Spain, Saric managed to seal a last-minute attempt by Pau Gasol to drag the game into an overtime basket offense.
The 76ers manager, Brett Brown, recently gave a high rating to the Spurs manager who believes he saw the shadow of Manu Ginobili as a young man in Sarriage.
Obviously, Saric has shown his talent and has the 76ers looking forward to him.
In Croatia's first two games, Saric scored 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric showed his ability to open up space on the field, hitting shots from outside the three-point line after parting with his teammates.
The 76ers currently have plenty of talented young players on the inside, but they don't have Saric's outside ability.
From capping to launching long passes and completing assists, there are only a handful of insiders who can do that in the NBA today.
Since the start of the Games, Saric has averaged 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in three games, a well-rounded performance.
James has signed two consecutive 1 + 1 contracts since deciding to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.
As the NBA's current collective bargaining agreement enters its final year, James will be at the forefront of collective bargaining as vice president of the NBA Players' Union.
Thanks to a new television deal and a battle between owners and players over what to do with the money, there are fears that the NBA will grind to a halt next summer, given the league's huge revenue boost.
But for James, he won't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer, having signed a three-year contract extension with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is under contract.
The mobile phone market has also seen a boom in small screens since the stunning debut of the iPhone SE.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.
The nubiaZ11mini continues its tradition of superior photography with a 5.0-inch screen that is easier to hold with one hand, and easy-to-use rear fingerprint recognition for a superior user experience.
Nubia's newly launched small screen camera phone, Z11mini, has reduced its price by 200 yuan, from 1,499 yuan to 1,299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, the nubiaZ11mini features a 5-inch 1080P screen, with the classic "little red circle" design still underneath the front.
The middle frame is made of metal and the bottom is symmetrically designed and equipped with a Type-C data interface.
The future of the Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty due to the cancellation of power supply contracts
The Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria, along with hundreds of workers at the plant, is facing an uncertain future as the power company that powers the plant has revealed that a plant owner will terminate a supply contract, thereby invalidating all supply contracts.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue paying subsidies to guarantee the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
Two thousand workers at Alcoa's Portland plant could face job losses.
As many as 2,000 people could lose their jobs, directly or indirectly, once factories close.
And with the plant accounting for about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity output, there could be a knock-on effect.
Alcoa closed the Cape Hanley smelter in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and is at risk of shutting down.
The move follows forecasts for factories over the next few years, initially driven by a stronger Australian dollar, and more recently by the price of factory products.
AGL, which supplies electricity to the large aluminium smelter through the old Eyang power plant in the Latrobe Valley, predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate their agreements.
The plant's largest shareholder is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while China's CITIC Group and Japan's Marubeni also hold a small stake.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, meaning the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts is 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
"As a result, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal 2017," the power company said.
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from FY2018 is currently subject to the futures market's optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had written down the contract value of $187 million in "termination activity expectations."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the smelter or guarantee its power supply."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Mr. Eyang in 2010 that would have come into effect in November, but did not explain why it pulled out of the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will close because of the industry's dire economic situation.
In response to comments from analysts earlier this week, AGL head of operations Stephen Mickelson said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and the Tomago plant about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories close, the demand for electricity in the market will be greatly reduced.
"This is not good news for us as an electricity company," he said.
Community legal centres shut out 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from community legal centres each year, a service that is already underfunded and now faces further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people are denied access to free legal advice and representation, mostly elderly people, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the resources to fight unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and now faces further funding cuts.
Federal funding for the centres will be cut by a further 30 per cent from June next year.
James Farrell, the head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, said thousands of people were turned away each year, according to the latest survey by the National Community Association's Law Centre.
Mr Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change existing decisions.
"The chronic underfunding of community legal centres in Queensland means thousands of people will not be able to access the vital services they need," he said.
People who need to stay away from violence, those with huge unpayable debts, those facing falling families, squeezed workers, all face legal problems, and the report shows they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by a further 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to confront complex legal issues without help.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland MP George Brandis to reverse these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need when they face legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to community legal centres and the needs of their corresponding communities, and the Bellevue Government must be invested in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged over staff pulling gun
New York: Trump's campaign has been sued for inaction after its Northern California chief pulled a gun on a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign, described the incident in state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Mr Bodini said he had previously hoped the matter would be resolved internally, but after months of waiting he realised "it can't happen."
According to Bodini, the chief, Earl Phillips, "drew a pistol, put his right index finger on the board, and pointed the gun at Vincent's kneecap."
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bodini learned from the dossier that at least four other people had gone through the same thing.
"Failure to shoot does not mean no harm will be done," Bodini said in the complaint.
The case comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee sparked outrage in North Carolina when he told a crowd that "people who support the Second Amendment," gun owners and gun enthusiasts, could take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and picked her favorite judge.
Trump's campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he was not advocating violence.
In his complaint, Bodini demanded compensation from the campaign for his neglect of oversight, as well as from Phillip for his assault, assault and mental injury.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
Philip could not be reached.
Phillip recently left the campaign, according to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not immediately respond to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been dogged by controversy.
The parties in this case are Bodini and Trump Presidential Campaign, 16-CS-14300, General Division of the High Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is the allure of Heathrow, just as in London in 2012 we did everything we could to ensure that our countries and regions could benefit from these events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the East End.
And we will once again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses around Heathrow.
In our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and lift the young people around the airport out of unemployment.
As was the case before the 2012 London Olympics, some thought Heathrow's expansion was too big.
I was told that Britain would not be ready for the Olympics and that we would be humiliated in front of the whole world.
The doubters are wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their suspicions about the Heathrow project will prove wrong.
While there will always be obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is addressing every one of the problems it faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not the few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and generate £211bn in economic growth, leaving a wealth of technology and jobs around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team that has completed £11bn of infrastructure investment projects on time and within budget, including Terminal T5, which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, and Terminal T2, which is located between two of the world's busiest runways.
Now they are preparing to build a third runway with £16bn of private investment.
The UK successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion project will also be a huge success.
This is a good time for us to pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow so that we can secure our future and create a technology and jobs fortune that will make Britain proud.
Lord Paul Dutton is chairman of the board of directors at Heathrow Airport and a former commercial counsellor to the UK Treasury
A woman killed herself and was run over on a Swiss motorway.
The victim was lying on the motorway at midnight.
Police are looking for witnesses after the woman who tried to kill herself was run over by a number of cars on the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway near Morges, Vaud, in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Police in the canton of Vaud said a woman was "desperate" to lie on the road late at night and was run over by multiple vehicles.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman who apparently acted with suicidal intent, was run over by a number of vehicles, including a lorry.
The woman died at the scene.
Police said several drivers involved in the incident have been investigated, but some have yet to be identified, and are now appealing for them and witnesses to the accident to come forward for investigation.
Lawyers for Gilles Hofstetter told the Geneva Tribune that a criminal investigation has now been opened, a routine process for such incidents.
But it is not yet known whether any drivers will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Mr Hofstetter said: "It will be up to prosecutors to determine."
Based on the results of two other similar cases over the past five years, the driver will not be held liable.
Both cases were caused by people taking to the highway late at night, the newspaper reported, and the final verdict was that drivers could not have expected pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Payet in August 2014.
The court heard the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
The judge said after the investigation that the policewoman was driving in a perfectly legal manner while the man's presence on the road was "completely unexpected and unpredictable" and that the policewoman called emergency services afterwards.
Anyone with information about the accident near Morges on Thursday should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Research have developed a model that explores the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was used to determine whether Venus, with its high surface temperature, no water and its atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, ever had an Earth-like environment.
Previously, scientists thought Venus's slower rotation was due to its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and was spinning just as slowly.
The model also shows the early topography of Venus.
Venus may have more dry regions than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic variation to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the light shining on Venus was 30 percent darker than on Earth.
"In model simulations at the Goddard Institute for Space Research, the slow rotation of Venus makes the day on its side last nearly two months," explained Anthony Del Geno, a scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that forms thick clouds that act like umbrellas to block much of the sun's heat from the ground.
The result of the simulation is that Venus' average climate temperature is actually several degrees lower than Earth's today.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus as predicted by previous planetary scientists.
Although life may have once existed on Venus, it was exposed to excessively high temperatures and ultraviolet light over the course of billions of years.
The planet's oceans evaporate and water vapour is burned out by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, all that was left was a thicker atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse gas effect, which formed Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published the results of a new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche manager
Patrick Roe, who stepped down as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche ice hockey team on Thursday, said he had no say at the team's decision-making level.
Joe Sacks, Colorado's executive vice president and general manager, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new head coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my responsibilities as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roe, 50, said in a statement.
I spent the summer thinking hard about how I could improve this team and give it the strength to take it to the next level.
To this end, the goals of the manager and vice-president must be aligned with those of the club.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
But for now, those conditions have not been met.
Sachis, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roe for his contribution to the team.
Mr Sages said: "Patrick told me about his decision today."
We thank him for his contribution to the club and wish him well in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for the league's best coach in his first season coaching the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He helped the club score 112 points and finish first in the central division, but Colorado was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season with 39 wins, 39 draws and four losses before losing their second wild card in the Western Conference Division by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roe has won four Stanley Cups, two each while playing for the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil field workers stop strikes and continue talks
The chief negotiator said workers at the North Sea oil fields had stopped striking over pay and that parties to the dispute had begun a new round of talks.
There have been a number of strikes on the North Sea oil platform run by Royal Dutch Shell against oilfield services company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute."
We will be reviewing these issues with a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks, starting early next week.
The union said its recent action, the first of its kind in 25 years, was in protest at a possible pay cut of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced compensation for North Sea contractors by about 9 per cent this year because of market pressures.
The pay cut comes after the company reduced compensation for maritime contractors by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said another pay cut would help it weather the market slump.
Shell has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because of the need to streamline its operations following its merger with British energy company British Gas Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices and the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves the majority and not the minority," Dave said in the statement.
Spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be no more than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The Kepler Space Telescope's latest mission has helped astronomers capture the most complete rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds and how their rotation cycles are related to the composition of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between star mass, age and even the history of our solar system by comparing our results with those of other clusters," said Rusa Reble, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are just reaching adulthood.
They reach the highest speed of rotation in their lifetime.
At their maximum rotational speed, these mature stars shoot out large amounts of stellar wind.
As these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they act as a brake on the star.
As a star ages, its rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars by tracking when recognizable sunspots, like sunspots, appear.
The latest set of rotation speed data indicates that the rotation speed of the more massive stars is slower than that of the less massive stars.
Rybl compared stars to dancers, with larger dancers spinning more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the" ballet performance "of the Pleiades cluster, we found that stars with slower rotation tend to be more massive, while those with the fastest rotation tend to be the lightest," says Mr Reble.
Because of its close proximity, the Pleiades cluster could serve as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the mass of stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades cluster provides the basis for theoretical models of the two-way rotation of young and old stars," says Mr Rybl.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation and "put away their dancing shoes."
Rybl and her colleagues detail their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Pleiades cluster in three new papers, which will be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
Zheng Jianjun, head of the South Lake Park Water Management Section, said that the deepest part of the South Lake is more than 10 meters, and those who do not understand the situation into the water are likely to be dangerous.
"Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, but still hope that the majority of boating tourists can wear life jackets, do not do illegal actions on the lake, safe play," Zheng Jianjun said.
Weitou Village has a unique marine environment, sitting on the natural ecology and human ecology of the two major leisure tourism resources.
"But individual owners who bought residential parking, fearing that doing so would affect their own rental prices, and suspecting that others have selfish motives, have been behind the damage, leading to the issue of parking space modification has been put on hold."
The academic community is still divided as to when and by whom sweet potatoes were introduced.
In the current more mainstream point of view, the introduction of sweet potato has three main lines.
The most influential and widespread of the three lines introduced by sweet potato is Chen Zhenlong's introduction to Fuzhou from the Philippines.
The Beijing Municipal Administration Office of Social Organizations will carry out special checks on the use of unified receipts for membership fees of social organizations from now on.
The inspection is divided into two types: unit self-examination and key spot check.
According to the official in charge of the municipal association office, the scope of this inspection includes the social organizations that received a unified receipt for membership fees from social organizations in the city from 2013 to 2015.
"The success of the Olympics is defined by the people who share stories on social media," the Rio organising committee said in its 2012 Olympic communications strategy.
And from the report of this Olympic Games, the media in the mode of communication, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects have made great changes than in the past.
The International Olympic Committee and media practitioners around the world look set to meet this round of challenges.
Everbright Securities' public offering of H shares entered its final day on August 11. News pointed to a muted market reaction in the first two days of the offering. It is scheduled to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
An analyst at a domestic brokerage said that Orient Securities was not on a good footing in Hong Kong and that its asset management business was the director of TSE, which appeared to be inherently inadequate compared with banks such as Bank of China International and Citic Securities.
Experts pointed out that so far this year with the return of the stock market flat, many brokerage performance has slipped, but the company listed after the situation to look more at the development of the company's own business, can not be generalized.
The new regulation after the introduction of Suzhou will become the first to restart the purchase of second-tier cities.
The second-tier cities that have introduced or are about to introduce policies to regulate the property market include not only Suzhou, but also cities such as Hefei and Nanjing.
Hefei has already taken the lead in issuing a policy of loan restrictions, with banks refusing to provide mortgage services to buyers who have two suites under the name of Hefei and have an outstanding home loan.
