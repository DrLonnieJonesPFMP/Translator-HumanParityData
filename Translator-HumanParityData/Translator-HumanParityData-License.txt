live, one of its affiliates). Please read them.  They apply to the Microsoft
Research dataset named above, which may include any associated materials,
text or speech files, associated media and "online" or electronic documentation
and any updates we provide in our discretion (together, the "Dataset"). The

internet-based services, and (iv) support services for this Dataset, unless
other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

            experimentation;
     ii.    for analyzing and testing purposes; and
